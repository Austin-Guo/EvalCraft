Most of these need to identify the locations of wireless sensor nodes , a challenging task because of the severe constraints on cost , energy and effective range of sensor devices .
The novel idea behind MSP is to reconstruct and estimate two dimensional location information for each sensor node by processing multiple one dimensional node sequences , easily obtained through loosely guided event distribution .
Because of unpredictable flow dynamics in airborne scenarios , it is not currently feasible to localize sensor nodes during massive UVA based deployment .
Although range based solutions can be suitably used in small scale indoor environments , they are considered less cost effective for large scale deployments .
These solutions demonstrate that long range and high accuracy localization can be achieved simultaneously with little additional cost at sensor nodes .
In addition , ranging signals generated by sensor nodes have a very limited effective range because of energy and form factor concerns .
This ranging technique performs very well as long as antennas are well oriented and environmental factors such as multi path effects and background noise are sufficiently addressed .
We proposed four novel optimization methods , exploiting order and marginal distribution among non anchor nodes as well as the feedback information from early localization results .
