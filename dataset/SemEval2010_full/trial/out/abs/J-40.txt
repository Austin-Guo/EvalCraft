Networks Preserving Evolutionary Equilibria and the Power of Randomization Michael Kearns mkearns@cis.upenn.edu Siddharth Suri ssuri@cis.upenn.edu Department of Computer and Information Science University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia , PA 19104 ABSTRACT We study a natural extension of classical evolutionary game theory to a setting in which pairwise interactions are restricted to the edges of an undirected graph or network .
The work described here is part of recent efforts examining the relationship between graph topology or structure and properties of equilibrium outcomes .
The standard model of evolutionary game theory considers an infinite population of organisms , each of which plays a strategy in a fixed , 2 player , symmetric game .
Before giving formal definitions , some comments are in order on what to expect in moving from the classical to the graph theoretic setting .
For example , at the group level , in the standard ESS definition , one need not discuss any particular set of mutants of population fraction .
These observations imply that in examining ESS on networks we face definitional choices that were obscured in the classical model .
In these papers the authors specify a simple , local dynamic for players to improve their payoffs by changing strategies , and analyze what type of strategies will grow to dominate the population .
NETWORKS PRESERVING ESS We now proceed to state and prove two complementary results in the network ESS model defined in Section 3 .
