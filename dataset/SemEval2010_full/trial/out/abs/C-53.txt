Like other distributed applications , CDMG also suffer from the consistency problem caused by network transmission delay .
In order to maintain consistency for distributed systems , many different approaches have been proposed , among which local lag and Dead Reckoning ( DR ) are two representative approaches .
In order to tackle the inconsistency caused by exceptional network transmission delay , a time warp based mechanism is proposed to repair the state .
By employing physical clock synchronization , GS DR can accurately calculate the states of shared entities after receiving state updates , and it can eliminate after inconsistency .
Traditional local lag requests that the lag value must be larger than typical network transmission delay , otherwise state repairs would flood the system .
Spaceship is a very simple networked computer game , in which players can control their spaceships to accelerate , decelerate , turn , and shoot spaceships controlled by remote players with laser beams .
The main purpose of performance evaluation is to study the effects of GS DR LL on decreasing before inconsistency in a particular game system under different thresholds , lags , and network transmission delays .
