We consider complex dependencies between multiple issues by modelling the preferences of the agents with a multi criteria decision aid tool , also enabling us to extract relevant information on a proposal assessment .
INTRODUCTION Multi issue negotiation protocols represent an important field of study since negotiation problems in the real world are often complex ones involving multiple issues .
Crisis management is a relatively new field of management and is composed of three types of activities : crisis prevention , operational preparedness and management of declared crisis .
The crisis prevention aims to bring the risk of crisis to an acceptable level and , when possible , avoid that the crisis actually happens .
The operational preparedness includes strategic advanced planning , training and simulation to ensure availability , rapid mobilisation and deployment of resources to deal with possible emergencies .
When a crisis is declared , the plans defined during the operational preparedness activity are executed .
Another motivation for using MAS lies in the fact that MAS is well known for facilitating automated negotiation at the operative decision making level in various applications .
Therefore , in this section , we describe the elements and constraints taken into account during the modelling phase and for the model itself .
