This framework allows us to model diverse economic interactions by picking the right attributes .
We study the computational complexity of two coalitional solution concepts for these gamesthe Shapley value and the core .
They have mines for various types of ores , and also mills capable of processing and producing different kinds of metal .
We provide an explicit bound on the maximum error of the estimate , and show that the bound is asymptotically tight .
PRELIMINARIES In this section , we will review the relevant concepts of coalitional game theory and its two most important solution concepts
We believe the problems of updating games and representing multiple games are interesting future directions to explore .
Given the natural probabilistic interpretation of the Shapley value , we believe that a random sampling approach may have significantly better theoretical guarantees .
A value for n person games .
