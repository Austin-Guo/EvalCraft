Overutilization of these system resources can yield unpredictable and unstable behavior , whereas under utilization can yield excessive system cost .
Two classes of applications QoS enabled and best effort use the multimedia system infrastructure described above to transmit video to their respective receivers .
In our study , emergency response applications belong to QoS enabled and surveillance applications belong to best effort class .
HyARM ensures efficient and predictable system performance by providing adaptive resource management , including monitoring of system resources and enforcing bounds on application resource utilization .
PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND ANALYSIS This section first describes the testbed that provides the infrastructu
These techniques aid in overcoming limitations with traditional scheduling approaches that handle dynamic changes in resource availability poorly and result in a rigidly scheduled system that adapts poorly to change .
HyARM employs hybrid control techniques to provide the adaptive middleware capabilities , such as resource monitoring and application adaptation that are key to providing the dynamic resource management capabilities for open DRE systems .
Comparing and Contrasting Adaptive Middleware Support in Wide Area and Embedded Distributed Object Applications .
