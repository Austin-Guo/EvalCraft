Content based filtering is one reliable method of combating this threat in its various forms , but some academic researchers and industrial practitioners disagree on how best to filter spam .
INTRODUCTION Electronic communication is increasingly plagued by unwanted or harmful content known as spam .
1.1 An Anti Spam Controversy The anti spam community has been divided on the choice of the best machine learning method for content based spam detection .
This Bayesian method requires only linear training time , and is easily implemented in an online setting with incremental updates .
Following standard machine learning practice , we tuned C on separate tuning data not used for later testing .
Because these values were not hand tuned , both generalization performance and runtime results are meaningful in these experiments .
Note the blog and splog data sets are relatively small , and results on these data sets must be considered preliminary .
CONCLUSIONS In the past , academic researchers and industrial practitioners have disagreed on the best method for online contentbased detection of spam on the web .
