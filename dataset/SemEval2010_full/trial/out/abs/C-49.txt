Opportunistic networking is one promising approach for those children to exchange information .
In this paper , we study protocols for routing messages between wireless networking devices carried by people .
Each device represents a unique person ( it is out of the scope of this paper when a device maybe carried by multiple people ) .
The PRoPHET protocol exchanges index messages as well as delivery probabilities .
Notice that our protocol replicates the message whenever a good looking relay comes along .
All protocols show similar delivery delays in both mean and median measures for medium TTLs , but differ for long and short TTLs .
Pocket switched networks and human mobility in conference environments .
Knowledge based opportunistic forwarding in vehicular wireless ad hoc networks .
