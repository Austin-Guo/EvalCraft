ABSTRACT
This paper proposes a framework for agent-based 
distributed machine learning and data mining based on (i)
the exchange of meta-level descriptions of individual 
learning processes among agents and (ii) online reasoning about
learning success and learning progress by learning agents.
We present an abstract architecture that enables agents to
exchange models of their local learning processes and 
introduces a number of different methods for integrating these
processes. This allows us to apply existing agent 
interaction mechanisms to distributed machine learning tasks,
thus leveraging the powerful coordination methods available
in agent-based computing, and enables agents to engage in
meta-reasoning about their own learning decisions. We 
apply this architecture to a real-world distributed clustering
application to illustrate how the conceptual framework can
be used in practical systems in which different learners may
be using different datasets, hypotheses and learning 
algorithms. We report on experimental results obtained using
this system, review related work on the subject, and discuss
potential future extensions to the framework.
