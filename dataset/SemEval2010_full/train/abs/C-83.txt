ABSTRACT
Collaborative document processing has been addressed by many
approaches so far, most of which focus on document versioning
and collaborative editing. We address this issue from a different
angle and describe the concept and architecture of a pervasive
document editing and managing system. It exploits database
techniques and real-time updating for sophisticated collaboration
scenarios on multiple devices. Each user is always served with 
upto-date documents and can organize his work based on document
meta data. For this, we present our conceptual architecture for
such a system and discuss it with an example.
