ABSTRACT
In this paper we develop a novel probabilistic model of 
computational trust that explicitly deals with correlated multi-dimensional
contracts. Our starting point is to consider an agent attempting to
estimate the utility of a contract, and we show that this leads to a
model of computational trust whereby an agent must determine a
vector of estimates that represent the probability that any 
dimension of the contract will be successfully fulfilled, and a covariance
matrix that describes the uncertainty and correlations in these 
probabilities. We present a formalism based on the Dirichlet distribution
that allows an agent to calculate these probabilities and correlations
from their direct experience of contract outcomes, and we show that
this leads to superior estimates compared to an alternative approach
using multiple independent beta distributions. We then show how
agents may use the sufficient statistics of this Dirichlet distribution
to communicate and fuse reputation within a decentralised 
reputation system. Finally, we present a novel solution to the problem
of rumour propagation within such systems. This solution uses the
notion of private and shared information, and provides estimates
consistent with a centralised reputation system, whilst maintaining
the anonymity of the agents, and avoiding bias and overconfidence.
