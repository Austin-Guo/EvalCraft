ABSTRACT
A model of providing service in a P2P network is analyzed.
It is shown that by adding a scrip system, a mechanism that
admits a reasonable Nash equilibrium that reduces free 
riding can be obtained. The effect of varying the total amount
of money (scrip) in the system on efficiency (i.e., social 
welfare) is analyzed, and it is shown that by maintaining the
appropriate ratio between the total amount of money and
the number of agents, efficiency is maximized. The work
has implications for many online systems, not only P2P 
networks but also a wide variety of online forums for which scrip
systems are popular, but formal analyses have been lacking.
