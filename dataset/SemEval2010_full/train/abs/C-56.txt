ABSTRACT
Grid is an emerging infrastructure used to share resources
among virtual organizations in a seamless manner and to
provide breakthrough computing power at low cost. 
Nowadays there are dozens of academic and commercial products
that allow execution of isolated tasks on grids, but few 
products support the enactment of long-running processes in a
distributed fashion. In order to address such subject, this
paper presents a programming model and an infrastructure
that hierarchically schedules process activities using 
available nodes in a wide grid environment. Their advantages
are automatic and structured distribution of activities and
easy process monitoring and steering.
