ABSTRACT
Ontologies building from text is still a time-consuming task which
justifies the growth of Ontology Learning. Our system named 
Dynamo is designed along this domain but following an original 
approach based on an adaptive multi-agent architecture. In this paper
we present a distributed hierarchical clustering algorithm, core of
our approach. It is evaluated and compared to a more conventional
centralized algorithm. We also present how it has been improved
using a multi-criteria approach. With those results in mind, we
discuss the limits of our system and add as perspectives the 
modifications required to reach a complete ontology building solution.
