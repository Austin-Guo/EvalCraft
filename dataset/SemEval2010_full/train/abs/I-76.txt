ABSTRACT
This paper studies a logical framework for automated 
negotiation between two agents. We suppose an agent who has
a knowledge base represented by a logic program. Then,
we introduce methods of constructing counter-proposals in
response to proposals made by an agent. To this end, we
combine the techniques of extended abduction in artificial
intelligence and relaxation in cooperative query answering
for databases. These techniques are respectively used for
producing conditional proposals and neighborhood proposals
in the process of negotiation. We provide a negotiation 
protocol based on the exchange of these proposals and develop
procedures for computing new proposals.
