ABSTRACT
In visual information retrieval the careful choice of suitable
proximity measures is a crucial success factor. The evaluation
presented in this paper aims at showing that the distance measures
suggested by the MPEG-7 group for the visual descriptors can be
beaten by general-purpose measures. Eight visual MPEG-7
descriptors were selected and 38 distance measures implemented.
Three media collections were created and assessed, performance
indicators developed and more than 22500 tests performed.
Additionally, a quantisation model was developed to be able to
use predicate-based distance measures on continuous data as well.
The evaluation shows that the distance measures recommended in
the MPEG-7-standard are among the best but that other measures
perform even better.
