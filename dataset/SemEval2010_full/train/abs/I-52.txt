ABSTRACT
This paper proposes a unified and general framework for
argumentation-based negotiation, in which the role of 
argumentation is formally analyzed. The framework makes it
possible to study the outcomes of an argumentation-based
negotiation. It shows what an agreement is, how it is related
to the theories of the agents, when it is possible, and how
this can be attained by the negotiating agents in this case.
It defines also the notion of concession, and shows in which
situation an agent will make one, as well as how it influences
the evolution of the dialogue.
