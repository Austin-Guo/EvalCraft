ABSTRACT
Lack of cooperation (free riding) is one of the key problems that
confronts today"s P2P systems. What makes this problem 
particularly difficult is the unique set of challenges that P2P systems
pose: large populations, high turnover, asymmetry of interest, 
collusion, zero-cost identities, and traitors. To tackle these challenges we
model the P2P system using the Generalized Prisoner"s Dilemma
(GPD), and propose the Reciprocative decision function as the 
basis of a family of incentives techniques. These techniques are fully
distributed and include: discriminating server selection, 
maxflowbased subjective reputation, and adaptive stranger policies. Through
simulation, we show that these techniques can drive a system of
strategic users to nearly optimal levels of cooperation.
