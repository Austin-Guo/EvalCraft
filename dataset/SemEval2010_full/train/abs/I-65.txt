ABSTRACT
We develop a new graphical representation for interactive partially
observable Markov decision processes (I-POMDPs) that is 
significantly more transparent and semantically clear than the previous
representation. These graphical models called interactive dynamic
influence diagrams (I-DIDs) seek to explicitly model the structure
that is often present in real-world problems by decomposing the 
situation into chance and decision variables, and the dependencies 
between the variables. I-DIDs generalize DIDs, which may be viewed
as graphical representations of POMDPs, to multiagent settings in
the same way that I-POMDPs generalize POMDPs. I-DIDs may be
used to compute the policy of an agent online as the agent acts and
observes in a setting that is populated by other interacting agents.
Using several examples, we show how I-DIDs may be applied and
demonstrate their usefulness.
