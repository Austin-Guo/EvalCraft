ABSTRACT
Work on argumentation-based dialogue has defined 
frameworks within which dialogues can be carried out, established
protocols that govern dialogues, and studied different 
properties of dialogues. This work has established the space in
which agents are permitted to interact through dialogues.
Recently, there has been increasing interest in the 
mechanisms agents might use to choose how to act - the 
rhetorical manoeuvring that they use to navigate through the space
defined by the rules of the dialogue. Key in such 
considerations is the idea of relevance, since a usual requirement is
that agents stay focussed on the subject of the dialogue and
only make relevant remarks. Here we study several notions
of relevance, showing how they can be related to both the
rules for carrying out dialogues and to rhetorical 
manoeuvring.
