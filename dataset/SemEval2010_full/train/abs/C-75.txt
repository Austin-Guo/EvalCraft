ABSTRACT
This paper considers the composition of a DIDS (Distributed
Intrusion Detection System) by integrating heterogeneous IDSs
(Intrusion Detection Systems). A Grid middleware is used for this
integration. In addition, an architecture for this integration is
proposed and validated through simulation.
