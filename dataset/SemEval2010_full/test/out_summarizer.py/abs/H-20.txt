General Terms Algorithms, Performance, Experimentation 1. INTRODUCTION Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) program aims to develop techniques which can effectively organize, search and structure news text materials from a variety of newswire and broadcast media [1].
And it was found that some classes of news could achieve better performance using named entity representation, while some other classes of news could achieve better performance using non named entity representation.
For preprocessing, we tokenize words, recognize abbreviations, normalize abbreviations, add part of speech tags, remove stopwords included in the stop list used in InQuery [14], replace words with their stems using K stem algorithm[15], and then generate word vector for each news story.
When a new term occurs in testing process, there are two solutions: simply ignore the new term or set df of the term as a small const (e.g. df = 1).
In incremental TF IDF model, document frequencies are updated dynamically in each time step t: 1( ) ( ) ( )t t D tdf w df w df wâˆ’= + (1) where Dt represents news story set received in time t, and dfDt(w) means the number of documents that term w occurs in, and dft(w) means the total number of documents that term w occurs in before time t.
Average correlation between term types and news classes where CMiss means the cost of missing a new story, PMiss means the probability of missing a new story, and PTarget means the probability of seeing a new story in the data; CFA means the cost of a false alarm, PFA means the probability of a false alarm, and PNontarget means the probability of seeing an old story.
The cost CDet is normalized such that a perfect system scores 0 and a trivial system, which is the better one of mark all stories as new or old, scores 1: ( ( * , * ) ) Det Det Miss Target FA Nontarget C Norm C min C P C P = (13) New event detection system gives two outputs for each story.
This is because story story comparisons usually yield greater similarities than story cluster ones, so stories tend to be combined Location Person Date Organization Money Percentage NN JJ CD Elections 0.37 1 0.04 0.58 0.08 0.03 0.32 0.13 0.1 Scandals/Hearings 0.66 0.62 0.28 1 0.11 0.02 0.27 0.13 0.05 Legal/Criminal Cases 0.48 1 0.02 0.62 0.15 0 0.22 0.24 0.09 Natural Disasters 1 0.27 0 0.04 0.04 0 0.25 0.04 0.02 Violence or War 1 0.36 0.02 0.14 0.02 0.04 0.21 0.11 0.02 Science and Discovery 0.11 1 0.01 0.22 0.08 0.12 0.19 0.08 0.03 Finances 1 0.45 0.04 0.98 0.13 0.02 0.29 0.06 0.05 Sports 0.16 0.27 0.01 1 0.02 0 0.11 0.03 0.01 together in system 3.
