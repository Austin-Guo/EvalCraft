We find that while with some smoothing methods, the new model and the multinomial model lead to exactly the same formula, with some other smoothing methods they diverge, and the Poisson model brings in more flexibility for smoothing.
Using the pseudo term formulation and a Poisson collection model, we can rewrite the retrieval formula as Score(d, q) ∝ w∈d∩q log(1 + 1 − δ δ e−λd,w (λd,w|q|)c(w,q) e−λd,C |q| (λd,C )c(w,q) ) + log (1 − δ)e−λd,N |q| + δe−λC,N |q| 1 − δ + δe−λC,N |q| (3) where λd,N = |d|− w∈q c(w,d) |d| and λC,N = |C|− w∈q c(w,C) |C| . 2.2.3 Two Stage Smoothing As discussed in [29], smoothing plays two roles in retrieval: (1) to improve the estimation of the document language model, and (2) to explain the common terms in the query.
Existing work on language model smoothing has already shown that different types of queries should be smoothed differently according to how discriminative the query terms are. [7] also predicted that different terms should have a different smoothing weights.
Experiment results show that the Poisson model with perterm smoothing outperforms multinomial model, and the performance can be further improved with two stage smoothing.

In this section, we conduct experiments to examine the benefits of using a mixture background model without extra computational cost, which can not be achieved for multinomial models.
