INTRODUCTION Operational Transformation (OT) was originally invented for consistency maintenance in plain text group editors [4].
After having designed, implemented, and experimented with a series of OT algorithms of increased complexity, we reflected on what had been learned and set out to develop a uniformed theoretical framework for better understanding and resolving OT problems, reducing its complexity, and 279 supporting its continual evolution.
Since the context of an operation corresponds to the document state on which the operation is defined, the problem of context representation can be reduced into the problem of document state representation.
This presentation does not specify what execution forms the original operations in DS should take to bring the document to the current state, but it captures essential and sufficient information for detecting whether two document states are the same and for deriving their differences in terms of original operations.
An eager coupling strategy was adopted: an inverse operation is coupled with its corresponding normal operation immediately after its execution.
In this regard, experimental methods like puzzle detection resolution can play an important role in gaining the necessary insights into the real correctness issues, and establishing suitable criteria and conditions for formal verification.
Formal verification of COT correctness with respect to these properties/conditions, and quantitative analysis of the time and space complexity of COT, shall be reported in a journal version of this paper.
The authors are grateful to Bo Begole and anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions which have helped improve the presentation of the paper.
