However, when the search results are diverse (e.g., due to ambiguity or multiple aspects of a topic) as is often the case in Web search, the ranked list presentation would not be effective; in such a case, it would be better to group the search results into clusters so that a user can easily navigate into a particular interesting group.
For example, the results in the first page returned from Google for the ambiguous query jaguar (as of Dec. 2nd, 2006) contain at least four different senses of jaguar (i.e., car, animal, software, and a sports team); even for a more refined query such as jaguar team picture, the results are still quite ambiguous, including at least four different jaguar teams   a wrestling team, a jaguar car team, Southwestern College Jaguar softball team, and Jacksonville Jaguar football team.
In this work, a text classifier is trained using a Web directory and search results are then classified into the predefined categories.
We construct our data set based on the MSN search log data set released by the Microsoft Live Labs in 2006 [14].
Since it is infeasible to ask the original user who submitted a query to judge the results for the query, we follow the work [11] and opt to use the clicks associated with the query in a session to approximate relevant documents.
Diversity Analysis: Intuitively, organizing search results into different aspects is more beneficial to those queries whose results are more diverse, as for such queries, the results tend to form two or more big clusters.
Given a query, we retrieve its related queries from past query history, learn the aspects by clustering the past queries and the associated clickthrough information, and categorize the search results into the aspects learned.
