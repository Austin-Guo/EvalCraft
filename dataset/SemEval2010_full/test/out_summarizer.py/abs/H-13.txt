While commercial Web search engines have followed similar approaches to caption display since their genesis, relatively little research has been published about methods for generating these captions and evaluating their impact on user behavior.
They generated snippets from spanning trees of document graphs and experimentally compared these snippets against the snippets generated for the same documents by the Google desktop search system and MSN desktop search system.
White et al. [17] evaluated three alternatives to the standard Web search interface: one that displays expanded summaries on mouse hovers, one that displays a list of top ranking sentences extracted from the results taken as a group, and one that updates this list automatically through implicit feedback.
Since 2000, the annual Document Understanding Conference (DUC) series, conducted by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology, has provided a vehicle for evaluating much of the research in document summarization2 .
A clickthrough inversion occurs at position N when the result at position N receives fewer clicks than the result at position N + 1. Following Joachims et al. [9], we interpret a clickthrough inversion as indicating a preference for the lower ranking result, overcoming any trust bias.
Users are identified by IP address, which is a reasonably reliable method of eliminating multiple results from a single user, at the cost of falsely eliminating results from multiple users sharing the same address.
For twothirds of the inversions (236), the page associated with caption A is at least as relevant as the page associated with caption B. For 28.7% of the inversions, A has greater relevance than B, which received the greater number of clickthroughs.
