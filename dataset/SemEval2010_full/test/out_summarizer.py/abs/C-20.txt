When using these technologies in a LAN environment, services execute in a virtual server, and the migration services provided by the underlying virtualization framework allows for a virtual server to be migrated from one physical server to another, without any significant downtime for the service or application.
However, since we propose to use WAN server migration as a means to deal with complete data center outages, these mechanisms are inadequate for our purposes and below we propose extension to remote replication technologies which can work in concert with server migration to minimize service downtime.
The second challenge comes from the fact that current routing protocols are well known to have convergence issues which is ill suited to the time constraints imposed by live migration.
In this section we illustrate how our cooperative, context aware approach can combine the technical building blocks described in the previous section to realize live server migration across a wide area network.
Figure 1 shows the environment where the application running in a virtual server VS has to be moved from a physical server in data center A to a physical server in data center B. Prior to the maintenance event, the coordinating migration management system (MMS) would signal to both the server management system as well as the network that a migration is imminent.
Specifically, as shown in Figure 1(b), the migration system will cause the network to create a tunnel between ¢©¨ and ¢©¨ which will be used subsequently to transfer data destined to VS to data center B.
Specifically, from this point in time, any traffic destined for the virtual server address that arrives at ¢©¨©¥ will be switched onto the tunnel to ¢©¨©§ for delivery to data center B. Note that at this point, from a server perspective the migration is complete as the VS is now active in data center B.
Recently live WAN migration using IP tunnels was demonstrated in [21], where an IP tunnel is set up from the source to destination server to transparently forward packets to and from the application; we advocate an alternate approach that assumes edge router support.
