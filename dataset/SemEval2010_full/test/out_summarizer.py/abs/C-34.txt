As one of the most fundamental security services, pairwise key establishment enables the sensor nodes to communicate securely with each other using cryptographic techniques.
However, due to the sensor nodes' limited computational capabilities, battery energy, and available memory, it is not feasible for them to use traditional pairwise key establishment techniques such as public key cryptography and key distribution center (KDC).
Inspired by the studies above and the polynomial based key pre distribution protocol [3], Liu et al. further developed the idea addressed in the previous works and proposed a general framework of polynomial pool based key predistribution [4].
The key contribution is that our scheme dose not require the assumption of all nodes can directly communicate with each other as the previous schemes do, and it still maintains high probability of key establishment, low memory overhead and good security performance.
For example: In the above Figure.2, node A((012),(1234)) can establish pairwise key with node B((121),(2334)) through the following key path: A((012),(1234)) → C((112),(1234)) → D((122),(1234)) → E((121),(1234)) → F((121),(2234)) → B((121),(2334)), where node F shall route through nodes G, H, I, J to establish direct pairwise key with node B. 57 According to the properties of H(k,u,m,v,n) model, we can prove that the following theorem by combing the proof of theorem 2: Theorem 3: Supposing that there exist no compromised nodes in the sensor network, and the distance between node A and B, then there exists a shortest key path with k distance between node A and B logically.
For example: Considering the key path establishment example given in the above section based on Figure.2: A((012),(1234)) → C((112),(1234)) → D((122),(1234)) → E((121),(1234)) → F((121),(2234)) → B((121),(2334)), supposing that node F((121),(2234)) has compromised, then from Figure.3, we can know that there exists another alternative key path as A((012),(1234)) → C((112),(1234)) → D((122),(1234)) →E((121),(1234)) → M((121),(1334)) → B((121),(2334)), which can be used to establish the indirect pairwise key between node A and B, where node E shall route through nodes D and K to establish direct pairwise key with node M, and node M shall route through nodes N, O, G, H, I, J to establish direct pairwise key with node B. Since the sensors are source limited, so they are easy to die or out of the communication radius, therefore the algorithm proposed in the above section cannot guarantee to establish correct key path efficiently.
If such kind of a correct key path exists, then through which node A can establish an indirect pairwise key with node B. Otherwise, node A fails to establish an indirect pairwise key with node B. And node A will tries again to establish an indirect pairwise key with node B some time later.
