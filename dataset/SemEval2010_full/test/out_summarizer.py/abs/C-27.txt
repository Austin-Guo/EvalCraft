The DV * family of localization schemes [21], uses the hop count from known beacon nodes to the nodes in the network to infer the distance.
Due to the stringent timing requirements and the delay caused by the buffering in the windowing system of a PC, we used the Full Screen Exclusive Mode API provided by Java2.
We explored the possibility of using and modifying the Linux kernel to expose the vertical synch (VSYNCH) interrupt, generated by the displaying device after each screen refresh, out of the kernel mode.
An event i will be time stamped with time ti, if the reading from the photo sensor dti, fulfills the condition: itdd <Δ+max where dmax is the maximum value reported by the photo sensor before ti and Δ is a constant which ensures that the first large detection gives the timestamp of the event (i.e. small variations around the first large signal are not considered).
And these results are achieved by using the Point Scan scheme, which required the highest Localization Time, as it was shown in Table 1. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 0 25 50 75 100 125 150 Event Size [cm] LocalizationTime[min] 3m/sec 6m/sec 9m/sec Figure 28.
The spectral response of a CdSe photo sensor spans almost the entire visible domain [37], with a peak at about 700nm (Figure 31 bottom).
We would like to thank S. Cornwell for allowing us to run experiments in the stadium, M. Klopf for his assistance with optics, and anonymous reviewers and our shepherd, Koen Langendoen, for their valuable feedback.
