In many machine learning and information retrieval tasks, there is no shortage of unlabeled data but labels are expensive.
Based on the observation that the closer to the SVM boundary an image is, the less reliable its classification is, SVM active learning selects those unlabeled images closest to the boundary to solicit user feedback so as to achieve maximal refinement on the hyperplane between the two classes.
By Gauss Markov theorem, we know that ˆw − w has a zero mean and a covariance matrix given by σ2 H−1 sse, where Hsse is the Hessian of Jsse(w) Hsse = ∂2 Jsse ∂w2 = k i=1 zizT i = ZZT where Z = (z1, z2, · · · , zk).
A common way to deal with this ill posed problem is to introduce a Tikhonov regularizer into our loss function: J(w) = k i=1 wT zi − yi 2 + λ1 2 m i,j=1 wT xi − wT xj 2 Sij +λ2 w 2 (5) The Hessian of the new loss function is given by: H = ∂2 J ∂w2 = ZZT + λ1XLXT + λ2I := ZZT + Λ where I is an identity matrix and Λ = λ1XLXT + λ2I.
The expected squared prediction error is E(y − ˆy)2 = E( + wT x − ˆwT x)2 = σ2 + xT [E(w − ˆw)(w − ˆw)T ]x = σ2 + xT [H−1 ΛwwT ΛH−1 + σ2 H−1 − σ2 H−1 ΛH−1 ]x Clearly the expected square prediction error depends on the explanatory variable x, therefore average expected square predictive error over the complete data set A is 1 m m i=1 E(yi − ˆwT xi)2 = 1 m m i=1 xT i [H−1 ΛwwT ΛH−1 + σ2 H−1 − σ2 H−1 ΛH−1 ]xi +σ2 = 1 m Tr(XT [σ2 H−1 + H−1 ΛwwT ΛH−1 − σ2 H−1 ΛH−1 ]X) +σ2 Since Tr(XT [H−1 ΛwwT ΛH−1 − σ2 H−1 ΛH−1 ]X) Tr(σ2 XT H−1 X), Our Laplacian optimality criterion is thus formulated by minimizing the trace of XT H−1 X. Definition 1. Laplacian Optimal Design min Z=(z1,··· ,zk) Tr XT ZZT + λ1XLXT + λ2I −1 X (11) where z1, · · · , zk are selected from {x1, · · · , xm}.
In this work, We combine 64 dimensional color histogram and 64 dimensional Color Texture Moment (CTM, [15]) to represent the images.
CTM adopts local Fourier transform as a texture representation scheme and derives eight characteristic maps to describe different aspects of co occurrence relations of image pixels in each channel of the (SVcosH, SVsinH, V) color space.
Also, although our primary interest in this paper is focused on relevance feedback image retrieval, our results may also be of interest to researchers in patten recognition and machine learning, especially when a large amount of data is available but only a limited samples can be labeled.
