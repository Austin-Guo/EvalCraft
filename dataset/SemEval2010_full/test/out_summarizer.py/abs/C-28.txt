Sensitivity is the rate at which the method fails to identify similar sequences whereas sensibility is the rate at which the method identifies sequences that are not similar [7].

We opted to replicate the segmented database in every slave grid node to improve data accesses times and to provide a potential for fault tolerance.
BLAST receives MASTER Strategies Allocation Work units Generate Work Units Distribute Reports Generate work units (to slaves)reports searches Figure 3: PackageBLAST architecture.
Finally, the module Generate Reports obtains the intermediary outputs sent by the slave nodes through file transfer and merges them into a single BLAST output report.
The slave processes τ database segments and notifies the master, which uses the last Ω notifications to compute the next allocation block size based on the selected allocation strategy and the weight provided by PSS.
To evaluate PSS, we executed PackageBLAST with 16 grid nodes, introducing local workload in nodes L01, L02, P01 and P02.
