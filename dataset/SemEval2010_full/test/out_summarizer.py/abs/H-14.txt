In previous work, such data have been used to improve search result ranking by Agichtein et al. [1].
Radlinski and Joachims [13] have utilized such collective user intelligence to improve retrieval accuracy by using sequences of consecutive query reformulations, yet their approach does not consider users" interactions beyond the search result page.
In prior work, O"Day and Jeffries [12] identified teleportation as an information seeking strategy employed by users jumping to their previously visited information targets, while Anderson et al. [2] applied similar principles to support the rapid navigation of Web sites on mobile devices.
To reduce the amount of noise from pages unrelated to the active search task that may pollute our data, search trails are terminated when one of the following events occurs: (1) a user returns to their homepage, checks e mail, logs in to an online service (e.g., MySpace or del.ico.us), types a URL or visits a bookmarked page; (2) a page is viewed for more than 30 minutes with no activity; (3) the user closes the active browser window.
Where query and destination term weights, an computed using standard tf.idf weighting and que session normalized smoothed tf.idf weighting, respec exploring alternative algorithms for the destination p remains an interesting challenge for future work, resu study described in subsequent sections demonstrate th approach provides robust, effective results.
Prior to the experiment all tasks were pilot tested with a small number of different subjects to help ensure that they were comparable in difficulty and selectability (i.e., the likelihood that a task would be chosen given the alternatives).
Since these tasks had no clearly defined termination criteria (i.e., the subject decided when they had gathered sufficient information), subjects generally spent longer searching, and consulted a broader range of information sources than in the known item tasks.
