In this work, we show how the model can be extended and used for query expansion using a technique that we call latent concept expansion (LCE).
The concepts used in their work are more general than those used in LCA, and include InQuery query language structures, such as #UW50(white house), which corresponds to the concept the terms white and house occur, in any order, within 50 terms of each other.
After tying the parameters in our clique sets together and using the exponential potential function form, we end up with the following simplified form of the joint distribution: log PG,Λ(Q, D) = λTD c∈TD fTD (c) + λOD c∈OD fOD (c) + λUD c∈UD fUD (c) FDQ(D,Q)   document and query dependent + λTQ c∈TQ fTQ (c) + λOQ c∈OQ fOQ (c) + λUQ c∈UQ fUQ (c) FQ(Q)   query dependent + λDfD(D) FD(D)   document dependent − log ZΛ document + query independent where FDQ, FQ, and FD are convenience functions defined by the document and query dependent, query dependent, and document dependent components of the joint distribution, respectively.
Although MRFs are generative models, it is inappropriate to train them using Feature Value fTD (qi, D) log (1 − α) tfqi,D |D| + α cfqi |C| fOD (qi, qi+1 . . . , qi+k, D) log (1 − β) tf#1(qi...qi+k),D |D| + β cf#1(qi...qi+k) |C| fUD (qi, ..., qj, D) log (1 − β) tf#uw(qi...qj ),D |D| + β cf#uw(qi...qj ) |C| fTQ (qi) − log cfqi |C| fOQ (qi, qi+1 . . . , qi+k) − log cf#1(qi...qi+k) |C| fUQ (qi, ..., qj) − log cf#uw(qi...qj ) |C| fD 0 Table 1: Feature functions used in Markov random field model.
The expansion term likelihoods are computed as follows: PH,Λ(e|Q) ∝ D∈RQ exp λTD w∈Q log (1 − α) tfw,D |D| + α cfw |C| + λOD b∈Q log (1 − β) tf#1(b),D |D| + β cf#1(b) |C| + λUD b∈Q log (1 − β) tf#uw(b),D |D| + β cf#uw(b) |C| + log (1 − α) tfe,D |D| + α cfe |C| λTD cfe |C| λTQ (4) where b ∈ Q denotes the set of bigrams in Q.
Although we found that expansion using multi term concepts failed to produce conclusive improvements in effectiveness, there are other potential tasks that these concepts may be useful for, such as query suggestion/reformulation, summarization, and concept mining.
Although we only provided the concepts generated for a single query, we note that the same analysis and conclusions generalize across other data sets, with coherent, topically related concepts being consistently generated using LCE.
