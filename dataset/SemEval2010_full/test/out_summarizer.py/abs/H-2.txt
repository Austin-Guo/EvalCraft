Search engines should not be able to know about a person"s interests, i.e., they should not be able to connect a specific person with the queries she issued, or worse, with the output URLs she clicked within the search interface1 (see Volokh [35] for a discussion on privacy issues related to personalized Web search).
Only two other approaches enhanced Web search using Desktop data, yet both used different core ideas: (1) Teevan et al. [34] modified the query term weights from the BM25 weighting scheme to incorporate user interests as captured by their Desktop indexes; (2) In Chirita et al. [6], we focused on re ranking the Web search output according to the cosine distance between each URL and a set of Desktop terms describing user"s interests.
Efthimiadis [11] presented a comprehensive literature review and proposed several simple methods to extract such new keywords based on term frequency, document frequency, etc.
For each term, we can easily compute off line those terms co occurring with it most frequently in a given collection (i.e., PIR in our case), and then exploit this information at run time in order to infer keywords highly correlated with the user query.
To further ensure a real life scenario, users were allowed to reject the proposed query and ask for a new one, if they considered it totally outside their interest areas.
Other solutions exist, but we think they are too computationally expensive for the huge amount of data that needs to be processed within Web applications.
Given the algorithms and clarity measures, we implemented the adaptivity procedure by tailoring the amount of expansion terms added to the original query, as a function of its ambiguity in the Web, as well as within user"s PIR.
We thank Ricardo Baeza Yates, Vassilis Plachouras, Carlos Castillo and Vanessa Murdock from Yahoo! for the interesting discussions about the experimental setup and the algorithms we presented.
