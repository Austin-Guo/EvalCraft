The first strategy involves both corner flapping and edge flipping for the ring atoms and stepwise rotation for side chains or backbone chains.
An example is a parametric search application: in such an application, it would be efficient if a large set of data could be pre loaded by the first call, and subsequent calls could be performed on the same data, but with different parameters.

When we obtained the best performance for 1L2Y using the Dennis and Ume clusters, the time for each structure optimization varied from 190 to 27,887 seconds, and the ratio between the longest and shortest times was 13.4.
Matsuoka et al.[16] has also discussed several design issues related to grid RPC systems.
