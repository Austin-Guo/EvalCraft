For example, for the TREC query Hubble telescope achievements, when a relevant document talks more about the telescope"s repair than its discoveries, irrelevant terms such as spacewalk can be added into the modified query.
With this model, the retrieval task involves estimating a query language model θq from a given query, a document language model θd from each document, and calculating their KL divergence D(θq||θd), which is then used to score the documents. [25] treats relevance feedback as a query model re estimation problem, i.e., computing an updated query model θq given the original query text and the extra evidence carried by the judged relevant documents.
If we combine the cluster models using weights determined this way and then interpolate with the original query model, we get the following formula for query updating, which we call CFB (Cluster FeedBack): p(w|θq ) = λp(w|θq) + (1 − λ) K i=1 L j=1 δti,j K k=1 L j=1 δtk,j p(w|θi) where L j=1 δti,j is the number of relevant terms in cluster Ci, and K k=1 L j=1 δtk,j is the total number of relevant terms.
We stem the terms, choose Dirichlet smoothing with a prior of 2000, and truncate query language models to 50 terms (these settings are used throughout the experiments).
Because the presentation terms within each cluster are generated in decreasing order of their frequencies, the presentation list forms a subset of the original one if its size is reduced2 .
We adopt the Simplified KL Divergence metric used in [24] to decide query expansion terms as our term relevance measure: σKLD(w) = p(w|R) log p(w|R) p(w|¬R) where p(w|R) is the probability that a relevant document contains term w, and p(w|¬R) is the probability that an irrelevant document contains w, both of which can be easily computed via maximum likelihood estimate given document level relevance judgment.
Third, we have plans to incorporate term feedback into our UCAIR toolbar[20], an Internet Explorer plugin, to make it work for web search.
