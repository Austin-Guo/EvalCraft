Kleinberg"s seminal work described how bursty features can be extracted from text streams using an infinite automaton model [12], which inspired a whole series of applications such as Kumar"s identification of bursty communities from Weblog graphs [13], Mei"s summarization of evolutionary themes in text streams [15], He"s clustering of text streams using bursty features [11], etc.
Our work differs from [9] in several ways: 1) we analyze every single feature, not only bursty features; 2) we classify features along two categorical dimensions (periodicity and power), yielding altogether five primary feature types; 3) we do not restrict each feature to exclusively belong to only one event.
Within T, there may exist certain events that occur only once, e.g., Tony Blair elected as Prime Minister of U.K., and other recurring events of various periodicities, e.g., weekly soccer matches.
Version 2 of the open source Lucene software [1] was used to tokenize the news text content and generate the document word vector.
After the removal of these stopwords, the distribution of weekday and weekend news are more or less matched, and in the ensuing experiments, we shall make use of the full corpus (weekdays and weekends).
Recall that selecting the features for one event should minimize the cost in Eq. 2 such that 1) the number of features span different events, and 2) not all features relevant to an event will be selected, e.g., the feature Clinton is representative to e12 but since Clinton relates to many other events, its time domain signal is far different from those of other representative features like Dole and Bob.
We also designed an unsupervised greedy algorithm to detect both aperiodic and periodic events, which was successful in detecting real events as shown in the evaluation on a real news stream.
