For instance, in the example above, SD450 brings pages about Canon cameras, while nc4200 brings pages about Compaq laptops, hence to a human the intent is quite clear.
The volume of queries in today"s search engines follows the familiar power law, where a few queries appear very often while most queries appear only a few times.
This result is in contrast with prior findings in query classification [20], but is supported by research in mainstream text classification [5].
This is because using too few search results provides too little external knowledge, while using too many results introduces extra noise.

The KDD task specification provided a small taxonomy (67 nodes) along with a set of labeled queries, and posed a challenge to use this training data to build a query classifier.
Our findings, however, are different from those reported by Shen et al. [19], who found summaries to yield better results.
