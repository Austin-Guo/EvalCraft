The decay of the utility function (for loss rates < 50%) is reduced, because the +l packets are protected and the endto end loss recovery can thus operate properly over a wider range of loss rates indicated by the shaded area.
In our evaluation we use two objective quality measures: the Enhanced Mod&d Bark Spectral Distortion (EMBSD, [21]) and the Measw ing Normalizing Blocks (MNB) described in the Appendix II of the ITU T Recommendation P.861 ([18]).
Packet marking, in addition to keeping the desirable property of state aggregration within the network core as proposed by the IETF Differentiated Services architecture, is exploited here to convey the intrbflow requirements of a llow.
As the core algorithm gives only a binary marking decision (protect the packet or not), we employ a simple algorithm to send the necessary  1 packets for compensation (Eq. 5): after a burst of +l packets has been sent, a corresponding number of  1 packets is sent immediately.
A larger number of Ic would help to reduce the relative overhead of the protocol header but also increases the packetization delay and makes sender classification and receiver concealment in case of packet loss (due to a larger loss gap) more difficult.

Frame based codecs amplify on one hand the impact of loss by error propagation, though on the other hand such coding schemes help to perform loss concealment by extrapolation of decoder state.
We would like to thank Wonho Yang and Robert Yantorno, Temple University, for providing the EMBSD software for the objective speech quality measurements.
