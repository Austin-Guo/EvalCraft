INTRODUCTION State of the art information retrieval systems commonly use machine learning techniques to learn ranking functions .
As a result , finding good probabilities requires solving a more difficult problem than necessary , likely requiring more training data to achieve the same MAP performance .
The second common approach is to learn a function that maximizes a surrogate measure .
This approach simplifies the process of obtaining ranking functions with high MAP performance by avoiding additional intermediate steps and heuristics .
One useful property of âˆ† map is that it is invariant to swapping two documents with equal relevance .
EXPERIMENT SETUP The main goal of our experiments is to evaluate whether directly optimizing MAP leads to improved MAP performance compared to conventional SVM methods that optimize a substitute loss such as accuracy or ROCArea .
The first index was generated using default settings , the second used Porter stemming , and the last used Porter stemming and Indri " s default stopwords .
This was simply an efficient means to normalize the outputs of different functions and allow for a more expressive model .
