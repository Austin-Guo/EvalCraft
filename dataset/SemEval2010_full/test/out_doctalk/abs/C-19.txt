They allow complex protocols to be implemented by decomposing them into several modules cooperating together .
The framework allowed us to compare the service and event based implementations of an adaptive group communication middleware .
However , they introduce an unnecessary burden on the protocol programmers and the stack composer .
However , the protocol programmer must take channels into account when implementing protocols .
In service based frameworks , requests , replies and notifications are issued to a service interface .
Both stacks allow the Consensus and Atomic Broadcast protocols to be dynamically updated .
Towards flexible finite state machine based protocol composition .
The architecture and performance of security protocols in the Ensemble group communication system .
