This new background model is shown to outperform the standard background model and reduce the sensitivity of retrieval performance to the smoothing parameter .
In Section 2 , we introduce the new family of query generation models with Poisson distribution , and present various smoothing methods which lead to different retrieval functions .
In the other extreme , we may focus on the terms in the query and ignore other terms , but some useful information may be lost by ignoring the nonquery t
As in existing language modeling approaches , the main challenge of constructing a reasonable retrieval model is to find a smoothed language model for p ( Â· | d ) .
We adopt their method to the Poisson two stage smoothing , and also estimate a per query coefficient for all the terms .
