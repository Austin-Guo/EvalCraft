INTRODUCTION Context awareness is a key concept in pervasive computing .
For example , different sensors report that the same person is in different places at the same time .
Negotiator may find current offer and reward worth more than counter offer which will delay the agreement , and accepts current offer and reward .
This pervasive negotiation is effective in repeated interaction because arguments can be constructed to directly impact future encounters .
Because numerical distance values of different properties are combined , e.g. location precision in metres with refresh rate in Hz , thus a standard scale for all dimension is needed .
EVALUATION In this section , we evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by simulated experiments .
They characterize various types and sources of imperfect context information and present a set of novel context modelling constructs .
The framework supports inconsistency detection based on a semantic matching and inconsistency triggering model , and inconsistency resolution with proactive actions to context sources .
