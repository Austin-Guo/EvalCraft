Such techniques are used to augment the original query to produce a representation that better reflects the underlying information need .
Finally , our proposed approach seamlessly provides a mechanism for generating both single and multi term concepts .
Results showed that combining single term and large window multi term concepts significantly improved effectiveness .
The nodes in the graph represent the random variables and the edges define the independence semantics of the distribution .
The correct choice of features depends largely on the retrieval task and the evaluation metric .
This distributional assumption locks the model into the bag of words representation and the implicit use of term occurrence features .
