We also perform model combination using several improved feedback language models obtained by a small number of new queries sampled from the original query .
2.3 Justification for a sampling approach The rationale for our sampling approach has two parts .
3.4 Retrieval robustness We use the term robustness to mean the worst case average precision performance of a feedback algorithm .
Much beyond this level , the additional benefits of more samples decrease as the initial score distribution is more closely fit and the processing time increases .
Stopwords can harm feedback if selected as feedback terms , because they are typically poor discriminators and waste valuable term slots .
RELATED WORK Our approach is related to previous work from several areas of information retrieval and machine learning .
A high performance semi supervised learning method for text chunking .
Improving retrieval feedback with multiple term ranking function combination .
