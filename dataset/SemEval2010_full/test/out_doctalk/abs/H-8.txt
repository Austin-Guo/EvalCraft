INTRODUCTION Consider an information retrieval researcher who has invented a new retrieval task .
The pooling method gives thousands of relevance judgments , but it requires many hours of ( paid ) annotator time .
This has found a wide array of uses in computer science and information retrieval .
The following theorem shows the utility of a maximum entropy distribution for relevance when estimating confidence .
The theorem and its proof say nothing whatsoever about the evaluation metric .
4.4.1 Hypothesis Testing Running multiple trials allows the use of statistical hypothesis testing to compare algorithms .
An easy derivation of logistic regression from the bayesian and maximum entropy perspective .
Probabilistic outputs for support vector machines and comparison to regularized likelihood methods .
