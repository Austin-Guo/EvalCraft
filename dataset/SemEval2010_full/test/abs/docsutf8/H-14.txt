ABSTRACT
We present a novel Web search interaction feature which, for a
given query, provides links to websites frequently visited by other
users with similar information needs. These popular destinations
complement traditional search results, allowing direct navigation to
authoritative resources for the query topic. Destinations are
identified using the history of search and browsing behavior of
many users over an extended time period, whose collective behavior
provides a basis for computing source authority. We describe a user
study which compared the suggestion of destinations with the
previously proposed suggestion of related queries, as well as with
traditional, unaided Web search. Results show that search enhanced
by destination suggestions outperforms other systems for
exploratory tasks, with best performance obtained from mining past
user behavior at query-level granularity.
