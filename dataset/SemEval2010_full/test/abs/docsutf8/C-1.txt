ABSTRACT
Efficient discovery of grid services is essential for the success of
grid computing. The standardization of grids based on web
services has resulted in the need for scalable web service
discovery mechanisms to be deployed in grids Even though UDDI
has been the de facto industry standard for web-services
discovery, imposed requirements of tight-replication among
registries and lack of autonomous control has severely hindered
its widespread deployment and usage. With the advent of grid
computing the scalability issue of UDDI will become a roadblock
that will prevent its deployment in grids. In this paper we present
our distributed web-service discovery architecture, called DUDE
(Distributed UDDI Deployment Engine). DUDE leverages DHT
(Distributed Hash Tables) as a rendezvous mechanism between
multiple UDDI registries. DUDE enables consumers to query
multiple registries, still at the same time allowing organizations to
have autonomous control over their registries.. Based on
preliminary prototype on PlanetLab, we believe that DUDE
architecture can support effective distribution of UDDI registries
thereby making UDDI more robust and also addressing its scaling
issues. Furthermore, The DUDE architecture for scalable
distribution can be applied beyond UDDI to any Grid Service
Discovery mechanism.
