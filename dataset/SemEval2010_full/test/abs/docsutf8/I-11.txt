ABSTRACT
Reasoning about agents that we observe in the world is 
challenging. Our available information is often limited to observations of
the agent"s external behavior in the past and present. To 
understand these actions, we need to deduce the agent"s internal state,
which includes not only rational elements (such as intentions and
plans), but also emotive ones (such as fear). In addition, we often
want to predict the agent"s future actions, which are constrained
not only by these inward characteristics, but also by the dynamics
of the agent"s interaction with its environment. BEE (Behavior
Evolution and Extrapolation) uses a faster-than-real-time 
agentbased model of the environment to characterize agents" internal
state by evolution against observed behavior, and then predict
their future behavior, taking into account the dynamics of their
interaction with the environment.
