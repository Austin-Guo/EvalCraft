ABSTRACT
Norms are widely recognised as a means of coordinating
multi-agent systems. The distributed management of norms
is a challenging issue and we observe a lack of truly 
distributed computational realisations of normative models. In
order to regulate the behaviour of autonomous agents that
take part in multiple, related activities, we propose a 
normative model, the Normative Structure (NS), an artifact that
is based on the propagation of normative positions 
(obligations, prohibitions, permissions), as consequences of agents"
actions. Within a NS, conflicts may arise due to the dynamic
nature of the MAS and the concurrency of agents" actions.
However, ensuring conflict-freedom of a NS at design time
is computationally intractable. We show this by 
formalising the notion of conflict, providing a mapping of NSs into
Coloured Petri Nets and borrowing well-known theoretical
results from that field. Since online conflict resolution is
required, we present a tractable algorithm to be employed
distributedly. We then demonstrate that this algorithm is
paramount for the distributed enactment of a NS.
