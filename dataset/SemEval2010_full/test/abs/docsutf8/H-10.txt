ABSTRACT
In recent years, document clustering has been receiving more
and more attentions as an important and fundamental 
technique for unsupervised document organization, automatic
topic extraction, and fast information retrieval or filtering.
In this paper, we propose a novel method for clustering 
documents using regularization. Unlike traditional globally 
regularized clustering methods, our method first construct a
local regularized linear label predictor for each document
vector, and then combine all those local regularizers with
a global smoothness regularizer. So we call our algorithm
Clustering with Local and Global Regularization (CLGR).
We will show that the cluster memberships of the 
documents can be achieved by eigenvalue decomposition of a
sparse symmetric matrix, which can be efficiently solved by
iterative methods. Finally our experimental evaluations on
several datasets are presented to show the superiorities of
CLGR over traditional document clustering methods.
