one jiffy).
After the Spotlight device receives the ACK, at its local time T4, the time synchronization can be achieved as follows: 2 )()( 4312 TTTT Offset −+− = (11) OffsetTTT spotlightnodeglobal +== We note that Equation 11 assumes that the one trip delays are the same in both directions.
In practice this does not hold well enough.
