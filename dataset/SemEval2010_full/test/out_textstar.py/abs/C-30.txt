Figure 10 shows the resulting bandwidth over time for the non disjoint strategy in which a node (and more importantly, the root of the tree) attempts to send all data to each of its children (subject to independent losses at individual child links).
Because the children transports throttle the sending rate at each parent, some data is inherently sent disjointly (by chance).
