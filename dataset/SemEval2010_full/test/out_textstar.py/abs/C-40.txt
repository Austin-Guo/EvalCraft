Section 5 reports on the quantitative analysis and Section 6 presents preliminary results of our simulation based experiments.
Finally, we conclude and address future research directions in Section 7.
However, these algorithms assume that all the candidate visible objects have been stored locally.
If the target objects are stored on remote servers, the clients receive the geometry items that are necessary for rendering from the server databases.
