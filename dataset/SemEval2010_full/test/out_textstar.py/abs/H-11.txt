Suppose n points have been selected, denoted by a matrix Zn = (z1, · · · , zn).
As can be seen, our LOD algorithm achieves 6.8% performance improvement for top 10 results, 5.2% for top 20 results, and 4.1% for top 30 results, comparing to the second best algorithm (LRR) after the first two rounds of relevance feedbacks.
6.4 Discussion Several experiments on Corel database have been systematically performed.
We would like to highlight several interesting points: 1.
