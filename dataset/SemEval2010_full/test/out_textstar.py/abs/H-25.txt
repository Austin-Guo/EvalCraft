The cluster models can be efficiently estimated using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm.
For its details, we refer the reader to [26].
K): The unigram language model of cluster Ci, as estimated using the theme discovery algorithm.
â€¢ T = {ti,j} (i = 1 .
Therefore, we try to combine the two methods, hoping to get the best out of both.
This supports our speculation that TCFB overcomes the drawbacks of TFB (paying attention only to checked terms) and CFB (not distinguishing checked and unchecked terms in a cluster).
Except for TCFB6C v.s.
We try to compare the quality of automatically inserted terms in relevance feedback with that of manually selected terms in term feedback.
