Rather than on Blundo's scheme their approach is based on Blom's scheme [6].
In some cases, it is essentially equivalent to the one in [4].
Obviously, from the supposing condition of The whole sensor network forms a connected graph, there is a route among those nodes.
Next, we will prove that m(u 1) ≥ x(v 1): m(u 1)= m(vt  1), x(v 1)= tm(v 1).
Construct a function as f(t)= vt  1  t(v 1), where t ≥ 2.
