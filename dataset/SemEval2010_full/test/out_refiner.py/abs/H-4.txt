INTRODUCTION Personal Information Management (PIM) is a rapidly growing area of research concerned with how people store, manage and re find information.
In section 5 we build on this work by examining methods for creating tasks that do not compromise the privacy of participants and discuss how our work can facilitate task based PIM user evaluations.
For example, consider the following recorded task: â€¢ LU4: re find AS"s paper on graded relevance assessments because I want to see how she presented her results for a paper I am writing This task actually consists of two sub tasks: 1 item task(refind the paper) and 1 lookup task (look for specific information within the paper).
Information that had been seen less than a day or less than a week before the task were defined as hot, information that had been seen less than a month before the task as warm, and information that had been seen less than a year or more than a year before the task as cold.
However there were also a number of re finding tasks that involved searching for older information: 23.30% of the tasks recorded (24.00% for email and 22.90% for web) involved searching for information accessed in the last month and 18.69% of the tasks recorded (24.67% for email and 15.27% for web) were looking for even older information.
For the look up task data, there was evidence that hot tasks were perceived easier than cold (p=0.0001) and that warm tasks were perceived easier than cold tasks(p=0.0041), but there was no evidence to distinguish between the difficulty ratings of hot and warm tasks(p=0.593).
Of the 30 tasks issued, 26 (86.67%) were completed without problems, 2 (6.67%) of the tasks were not completed because the description recorded was insufficent to recreate the task, and 2 tasks (6.67%) were not completed because the task was too difficult or the required web page no longer existed.
A further advantage of using simulated tasks in this way, rather than real tasks, is that some of the users will not have performed the task in the recent past and this allows the examination of tasks that look for information of different temperatures.
