From theorem 2, it is easy to know that any source node A can compute out a key path P to the destination node B according to the above algorithm, when there are no compromised nodes in the sensor network.
For example: In the above Figure.2, node A((012),(1234)) can establish pairwise key with node B((121),(2334)) through the following key path: A((012),(1234)) → C((112),(1234)) → D((122),(1234)) → E((121),(1234)) → F((121),(2234)) → B((121),(2334)), where node F shall route through nodes G, H, I, J to establish direct pairwise key with node B. 57 According to the properties of H(k,u,m,v,n) model, we can prove that the following theorem by combing the proof of theorem 2: Theorem 3: Supposing that there exist no compromised nodes in the sensor network, and the distance between node A and B, then there exists a shortest key path with k distance between node A and B logically.
For example: Considering the key path establishment example given in the above section based on Figure.2: A((012),(1234)) → C((112),(1234)) → D((122),(1234)) → E((121),(1234)) → F((121),(2234)) → B((121),(2334)), supposing that node F((121),(2234)) has compromised, then from Figure.3, we can know that there exists another alternative key path as A((012),(1234)) → C((112),(1234)) → D((122),(1234)) →E((121),(1234)) → M((121),(1334)) → B((121),(2334)), which can be used to establish the indirect pairwise key between node A and B, where node E shall route through nodes D and K to establish direct pairwise key with node M, and node M shall route through nodes N, O, G, H, I, J to establish direct pairwise key with node B. Since the sensors are source limited, so they are easy to die or out of the communication radius, therefore the algorithm proposed in the above section cannot guarantee to establish correct key path efficiently.
If such kind of a correct key path exists, then through which node A can establish an indirect pairwise key with node B. Otherwise, node A fails to establish an indirect pairwise key with node B. And node A will tries again to establish an indirect pairwise key with node B some time later.
From Figure.4, it is easy to know that by using new pairwise key predistribution scheme based on H(k,u,m,v,n) model, the probability of direct pairwise key establishment between any two nodes decreases with the increasing of the scale of the sensor networks, and in addition, the probability of direct pairwise key establishment between any two nodes decreases with the increasing of the dimension n, when the scale of the sensor network is fixed.
Theorem 4: Supposing that the total sensors is N in the sensor network, then when u ≥ v2 , the probability of direct pairwise key establishment between any two nodes, when using the key distribution scheme based on the hypercube model H(v,p), is smaller than that when using the key distribution scheme based on the H(k,u,m,v,n) model.
Supposing that the total number of nodes in the sensor network is N, Figure.5 illustrates the comparison between the probability of direct pairwise key establishment between any two nodes based on the H(k,u,m,v,n) model and the probability of direct pairwise key establishment between any two nodes based on the H(v,p) model, when u=4 and v=2.
