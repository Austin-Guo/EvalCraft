Considering that a real time flow may experience some packet loss, the impact of loss may vary significantly dependent on which packets are lost within a flow.
The transition probabilities for 1 < lc < m can be computed easily as: p(k  l)(k) = P(X>klX>k l)= P(X>knX>k 1) P(X>k 1) ZZ P ( X > k ) P(X>k 1) These conditional loss probabilities again can be approxPzl,cum(k) _ Cnm,k on i m a t e d by PL,cond@) = PL,cum(k l)   C;Ek  l 0,. For 443 Figure 2: Loss run length model with m + 1 states P(X = m]X = m) we have: PL,,,d(rn) = %Lf;:P Fig. 2 shows the Markov chain for the model.
These two objective quality measure.~ are reported to have a very high correlation with subjective tests, their relation to the range of subjective test result values (MOS) is close to being linear and they are recommended as being suitable for the evaluation of speech degraded by transmission errors in real network environments such as bit errors and frame erasures ([18, 211).
Rosenberg has done a similar experiment ([9]), showing that the difference between the original and the concealed signal with increasing loss burstiness in terms of a mean squared error is significant, however.
The decoder fails to conceal the loss of voiced frames at an unvoiced/voiced transition because it attempts to conceal the loss of voiced frames using the filter coefficients and the excitation for an unvoiced sound.
Moreover, because the G.729 encoder uses a moving average filter to predict the values of the line spectral pairs and only transmits the difference between the real and predicted vaues, it takes a lot of time for the decoder to resynchronize with the encoder once it has failed to build the appropriate linear prediction filter.
As the core algorithm gives only a binary marking decision (protect the packet or not), we employ a simple algorithm to send the necessary  1 packets for compensation (Eq. 5): after a burst of +l packets has been sent, a corresponding number of  1 packets is sent immediately.
Best effort packets (designated by 0 in Fig. 14) are dropped with the probability pc, whereas packets marked with +l and  1 are dropped with probabilities of p+i and p 1 respectively.
