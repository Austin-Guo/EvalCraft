Analytical results, supported by measurements based on the multi user 007 benchmark, indicate that for typical Internet latencies BuddyCache provides significant performance benefits, e.g. for latencies ranging from 40 to 80 milliseconds round trip time, clients using the BuddyCache can reduce by up to 50% the latency of access to shared objects compared to the clients accessing the repository directly.
The transactional caching taxonomy [19] proposed by Carey, Franklin and Livny classifies the coherence protocols into two main categories according to whether a protocol avoids or detects access to stale objects in the client cache.
The version number satisfies the following invariant V P about the state of objects on a page: if a cached page P has a version number v, then the value of an object o on a cached page P is either invalid or it reflects at least the modifications committed by transactions preceding the transaction that set P"s version number to v.
Higher network latency increases the relative performance advantage provided by peer fetch relative to direct fetch but this benefit is offset by the increased commit times.
This paper described BuddyCache, a new transactional cooperative caching [20, 16, 13, 2, 28] technique that improves the latency of access to shared persistent objects for collaborative strong consistency applications in high latency network environments.

A transaction running at the client during a failover and committing after the failover is treated as a regular transaction, a transaction trying to commit during a failover is aborted by the failover protocol.
