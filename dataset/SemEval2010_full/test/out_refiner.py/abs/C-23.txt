Therefore, it is important to reduce the differences in finishing time among replica servers.
In this paper, we propose a dynamic co allocation scheme based on co allocation Grid data transfer architecture called RecursiveAdjustment Co Allocation scheme that reduces the idle time spent waiting for the slowest server and improves data transfer performance [24].
The Aggressive Load Balancing dynamic co allocation strategy presented in [17] adds functions that change block size de liveries by: (1) progressively increasing the amounts of data requested from faster servers, and (2) reducing the amounts of data requested from slower servers or ceasing to request data from them altogether.
The three influencing factors in this formula: WBW , WCPU , and WI/O describe CPU, I/O, and network bandwidth weights, which can be determined by Data Grid organization administrators according to the various attributes of the storage systems in Data Grid nodes since some storage equipment does not affect CPU loading.
Time: Transmission time is measured from the time when the client starts transferring to the time when all transmission jobs are finished, and it includes the time 800 required for resetting data channels between transfer requests.
Of course, this makes it necessary to maintain the original splitting order.
We analyze the performance of each scheme by comparing their transfer finish time, and the total idle time faster servers spent waiting for the slowest server to finish delivering the last block.
