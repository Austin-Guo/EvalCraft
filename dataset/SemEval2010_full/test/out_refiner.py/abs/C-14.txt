The probability of a consensus false target detection is Fv = Prob n i=1 Ni ≥ η . (2) As above, if the noise processes at the sensors are independent and AWGN, then the false alarm probability can be computed from the Chi square distribution of degree n. 2.1.2 Decision Fusion.
To reduce the number of sensors deployed, only part of the available sensors can be deployed first and the sensors can then report their position.
If it does not, additional sensors can be deployed until the desired exposure level is reached or until the all M available sensors are deployed.
In general, the optimal cost solution is neither deploying one sensor at a time nor deploying all the sensors at a time.
The position of sensors are random in the region of interest R and for a given num45 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 Minimum exposure Density 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 0 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 Minimum exposure Density 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 Minimum exposure Density 5 sensors 10 sensors 15 sensors Figure 4: Probability density function for the distribution of minimum exposure for deployments of 5, 10 and 15 sensors.
To evaluate the probability that the exposure ed is reached after additional sensor deployment, we make the following approximation: the distribution of exposure for n sensors is independent of the exposure corresponding to k of these n sensors, 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1.
Indeed, a given minimum exposure can correspond to many different deployment positions, some of which can be easily improved by deploying a few additional sensors (e.g. when there is a empty space in the region coverage), some of which can only be improved by deploying many additional sensors (e.g. when the sensors are evenly distributed on the region).
The confidence for ed when deploying 40 sensors is above .999, which is sufficient for most applications, and therefore we did not evaluate the distribution of exposure when deploying more than 40 sensors.
