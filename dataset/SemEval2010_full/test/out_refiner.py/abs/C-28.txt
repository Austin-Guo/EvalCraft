It distributes sequences among the grid nodes using two allocation policies: FCFS and minmax.
Having decided which sequences will be compared by each node, GridBlast sends the sequences, the executable files and the whole database to the chosen node.
We also propose a strategy to compute grid nodes execution weight which distributes work units (database segments) to grid nodes according to their current computational power.
Φ(m, pi, P ) = P ∗ P i=1 Γ(m,pi,Ω) Γ(m,pi,Ω) P i=1 P i=1 Γ(m,pi,Ω) Γ(m,pi,Ω) (12) Γ(m, pi, Ω) (equation 13) specifies the average computing time of a segment in a node pi, considering the last Ω notifications of TE(m, pi, τ), which is the average computation time of τ work units (database segments) assigned by the master m to a slave pi.

To evaluate PSS, we executed PackageBLAST with 16 grid nodes, introducing local workload in nodes L01, L02, P01 and P02.
