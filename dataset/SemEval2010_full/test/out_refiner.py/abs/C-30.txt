Once a node has chosen the best node it sends it a peering request containing the requesting node"s Bloom filter.
Given a physical network represented as a graph G = (V, E), set of overlay participants P ⊂ V , source node (s ∈ P), bandwidth B : E → R+ , loss rate L : E → [0, 1], propagation delay D : E → R+ of each link, set of possible overlay links O = {(v, w) | v, w ∈ P, v = w}, routing table RT : O × E → {0, 1}, find the overlay tree T = {o | o ∈ O} (|T| = |P| − 1, ∀v ∈ P there exists a path ov = s ❀ v) that maximizes min o|o∈T (min(f(o), min e|e∈o b(e) |{p | p ∈ T, e ∈ p}| )) where f(o) is the TCP steady state sending rate, computed from round trip time d(o) = Èe∈o d(e) + Èe∈o d(e) (given overlay link o = (v, w), o = (w, v)), and loss rate l(o) = 1 − Ée∈o (1 − l(e)).
We have evaluated Bullet under a number of bandwidth constraints to determine how Bullet performs relative to the 0 200 400 600 800 1000 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 Bandwidth(Kbps) Time (s) Raw total Useful total From parent Figure 7: Achieved bandwidth over time for Bullet over a random tree.
Since there is currently ample bandwidth available throughout the PlanetLab overlay (a characteristic not necessarily representative of the Internet at large), we designed this experiment to show that Bullet can achieve higher bandwidth than an overlay tree when the source is constrained, for instance in cases of congestion on its outbound access link, or of overload by a flash crowd.
More importantly, the multicast recovery methods are limited by the bandwidth through the tree, while Bullet strives to provide more bandwidth to all receivers by making data deliberately disjoint throughout the tree.
A large scale evaluation of 1000 overlay participants running in an emulated 20,000 node network topology, as well as experimentation on top of the PlanetLab Internet testbed, shows that Bullet running over a random tree can achieve twice the throughput of streaming over a traditional bandwidth tree.
