However, the two tier architecture may have a significant drawback in terms of its result quality compared to the full replication of IF ; given the fact that the p index contains only a subset of the data of the full index, it is possible that, for some queries, the p index may not contain the top ranked document according to the particular ranking criteria used by the search engine and fail to return it as the top page, leading to noticeable quality degradation in search results.
We use the top k result from the p index only if we know for sure that the result is the same as the top k result from the full index.
In the algorithm, when we compute the result from IP (Step 1), we compute not only the top k result A, but also the correctness indicator function C defined as follows: Definition 1 (Correctness indicator function) Given a query q, the p index IP returns the answer A together with a correctness indicator function C. C is set to 1 if A is guaranteed to be identical (i.e. same results in the same order) to the result computed from the full index IF .
Thus, as long as search engines can compute the first few top k answers correctly, users often will not notice that the search engine actually has not computed the correct answer for the remaining results (unless the users explicitly request them).
In other words, if all keywords in q appear in IP , the answer computed from IP is guaranteed to be the same as the answer computed from IF .
The main problem of global PR based document pruning policies is that we do not know the term relevance score tr(D, ti) of the pruned documents, so a document not in IP may have a higher ranking score than the ones returned from IP because of their high tr scores.
Theorem 4 Given an inverted index IP pruned by the algorithm in Figure 9, a query q = {t1, . . . , tw} and a monotonic ranking function, the top k result from IP computed by Algorithm 4.6 is the same as the top k result from IF if C = 1.
