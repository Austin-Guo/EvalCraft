In Section 4, we first propose the iterative greedy algorithm of topic segmentation and alignment with term co clustering, and then describe how the algorithm can be optimized by usFigure 1: Illustration of multi document segmentation and alignment.
Since for different documents si may discuss different sub topics, our goal is to cluster adjacent sentences in each document into segments, and align similar segments among documents, so that for different documents ˆsi is about the same sub topic.
In topic segmentation and alignment of multiple documents, if P(D, ˆS, T) is known, based on the marginal distributions P(D|T) and P( ˆS|T) for each term t ∈ T, we can categorize terms into four types in the data set: • Common stop words are common both along the dimensions of documents and segments.
Sd into p segments sequentially (some segments may be empty), and put them into the p segments ˆS of the whole training set D (all possible cases of different segmentation Segd and alignment Alid are checked) to find the optimal case, and (2) based on the current segmentation and alignment, for each term t, the algorithm finds the best term cluster of t based on the current segmentation Segd and alignment Alid.
It is more likely to treat the same segments of different documents as different segments under the effect of document dependent stop words and noisy words.
First, because samples vote for the best multi document segmentation and alignment, but if only two documents are compared with each other, the one with missing segments or a totally different sequence will affect the correct segmentation and alignment of the other.
For single document Table 6: Multi document Segmentation: Average Error Rate for Document Number = 5 in Each Subset with Different Number of Term Clusters #Cluster 75 100 150 250 l MIk 24.67% 24.54% 23.91% 22.59% 15.77% segmentation, WMIl is even a little bit worse than MIl, which is similar as the results of the single document segmentation on the first data set.
