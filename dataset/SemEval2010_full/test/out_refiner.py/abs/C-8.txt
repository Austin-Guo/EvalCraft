INTRODUCTION Operational Transformation (OT) was originally invented for consistency maintenance in plain text group editors [4].
For any operation O, its inverse is denoted by O. Since every transformed operation must come from an original operation, we use the notation org(O) to denote the original operation of O.
This presentation does not specify what execution forms the original operations in DS should take to bring the document to the current state, but it captures essential and sufficient information for detecting whether two document states are the same and for deriving their differences in terms of original operations.
An original inverse operation can be generated to undo an original normal operation, or to redo an undone operation.
For example, inverse operation O may be generated to undo O, and O may be generated to undo O. Both O and O correspond to the same normal operation O. Based on this observation, all original inverse operations in an operation context can be grouped by their corresponding original normal operations: one inverse group for each undone original normal operation.
The COT algorithm provides uniformed solutions to both consistency maintenance and undo problems; it is simpler and more efficient than prior OT control algorithms with similar capabilities; and it significantly simplifies the design of transformation functions.
