The DV * family of localization schemes [21], uses the hop count from known beacon nodes to the nodes in the network to infer the distance.
The sensor nodes detect the events and report back to the Spotlight device, through a base station, the timestamps when the events were detected.
Row major Consecutive placement Greedy Placement Figure 8. Localization error with code placement and no ECC As Figure 8 shows, if no error detection/correction capability is present and 1 bit errors occur, then our Greedy Placement method can reduce the localization error by an average 23%, when compared to the Row Major Placement.
If a node detects one event, it is hard for it to estimate the exact location of itself within the event.
An event i will be time stamped with time ti, if the reading from the photo sensor dti, fulfills the condition: itdd <Δ+max where dmax is the maximum value reported by the photo sensor before ti and Δ is a constant which ensures that the first large detection gives the timestamp of the event (i.e. small variations around the first large signal are not considered).
And these results are achieved by using the Point Scan scheme, which required the highest Localization Time, as it was shown in Table 1. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 0 25 50 75 100 125 150 Event Size [cm] LocalizationTime[min] 3m/sec 6m/sec 9m/sec Figure 28.
This error is currently state of art, even for range based localization systems and it is 75% smaller than the error obtained when using GPS devices or when the manual deployment of sensor nodes is a feasible option [31].
