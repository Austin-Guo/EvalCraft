Radlinski and Joachims [13] have utilized such collective user intelligence to improve retrieval accuracy by using sequences of consecutive query reformulations, yet their approach does not consider users" interactions beyond the search result page.
The results indicate that suggesting popular destinations to users attempting exploratory tasks provides best results in key aspects of the information seeking experience, while providing query refinement suggestions is most desirable for known item tasks.
One set is com most frequent such queries, while the second set cont frequent queries that followed the target query in que candidate query is then scored by multiplying its sm frequency by its smoothed frequency of following th in past search sessions, using Laplacian smoothing.
All are familiar with Web search, and conduct 7.5 searches per day on average (SD=4.1).
The findings obtained from our study on subjects" perceptions of the four systems indicate that subjects tend to prefer QueryDestination for the exploratory tasks and QuerySuggestion for the known item searches.
Scale Known item Exploratory B QS QD SD B QS QD SD Queries 1.9 4.2 1.5 2.4 3.1 5.7 2.7 3.5 Result clicks 2.6 2 1.7 2.4 3.4 4.3 2.3 5.1 Subjects submitted fewer queries and clicked on fewer search results in QueryDestination than in any of the other systems.
Results of our study revealed that: (i) systems suggesting query refinements were preferred for known item tasks, (ii) systems offering popular destinations were preferred for exploratory search tasks, and (iii) destinations should be mined from the end of query trails, not session trails.
