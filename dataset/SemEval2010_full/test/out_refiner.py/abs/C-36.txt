In our discussion we refer to the client hosting brokers as publisher hosting brokers (PHB) or subscriber hosting brokers (SHB) depending on whether the connected client is a publisher or 105 IB SHB Sub Pub Pub Sub Sub IB PHB IB IB PHB IB IB IB IB SHB SHB IBIB IB IB IB IB IB IBIB IB TO IB IB IB Metropolitan Police Domain Congestion Charge Service Domain PITO Domain Detective Smith Camera 1 Camera 2 Billing Office Statistics Office Sub Subscriber SHB Subscriber Hosting Broker Pub Publisher PHB Publisher Hosting Broker TO Type Owner IB Intermediate Broker KEY Figure 1: An overall view of our multi domain publish/subscribe deployment a subscriber, respectively.
In this section we discuss encrypting event content both at the event level and the attribute level; avoiding leaking information to unauthorised brokers by encrypting subscription filters; avoiding unnecessary encryptions between authorised brokers; and finally, how event content encryption was implemented in our prototype.
Compared with event encryption, attribute encryption usually results in larger processing overheads, because each attribute is encrypted separately.
With attribute encryption it is possible that the neighbouring broker is authorised to access a subset of the decrypted attributes, in which case those attributes that the broker is not authorised to access would be passed to it encrypted.
In Hermes the rendezvous node for each event type is selected uniformly randomly (the event type name is hashed with the SHA 1 hash algorithm to produce the event type 108 PHB IBIB IB SHB RN IB SHB Figure 2: Node addressing is evenly distributed across the network, thus rendezvous nodes may lie outside the domain that owns an event type IB IB SHBPHBP S Encrypts Filters from cache Decrypts, delivers Decrypts, filters Plaintext Cached Plaintext (most data) Cached Plaintext (some data) Different domains Cyphertext KEY Figure 3: Caching decrypted data to increase efficiency when delivering to peers with equivalent security privileges identifier, then the identifier is used to select the rendezvous node in the structured overlay network).
The cache is accessed by the broker when it delivers an event to a local subscriber after first seeing if the event matches the subscription filter, but the broker also sends the cache to the next broker with the encrypted event.
By controlling access to the encryption key we effectively control access to the encrypted event content.
As can be seen in Fig. 6, event content encryption introduces a large overhead compared to not using encryption.
