G allocates the processes of trial structure optimization, which are performed by the computation nodes of a PC cluster in the MPI version of CONFLEX, to the computational nodes of each cluster in a grid environment.
This facility automatically calls the initialization function, which is contained in the worker program, once the client program invokes the worker program in a remote node.
The University of Tsukuba and AIST are connected by a 1 Gbps Tsukuba WAN, and the other PC clusters are connected by SINET, which is wide area network dedicated to academic research in Japan.

It is necessary to refine the algorithm used to generate the trial structure, which suppresses the time variation for optimizing a trial structure in CONFLEX.
In this experiment, we used a simple build in roundrobbin scheduler of OmniRPC, which is necessary in order to apply the scheduler that allocates structures with long optimization times to a high performance Table 8: Statistics of elapsed time of trial structure optimization using 28 workers in the Dennis cluster.
Matsuoka et al.[16] has also discussed several design issues related to grid RPC systems.
