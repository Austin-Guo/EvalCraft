A user profile is usually a classifier that can identify whether a document is relevant to the user or not, or a regression model that tells how relevant a document is to the user.
Assume there are M users in the system.
Second, the parameters estimated at the modified M step (Equations 12   13) are more accurate than the standard M step described in Section 4.1 because the exact analytical solutions ¯wm,k = µk and σm,k = σk for the unrelated (m, k) pairs were used in the new algorithm instead of an approximate solution as in the standard algorithm.
Norm 2 regularized linear models are equivalent to the Bayesian hierarchical models learned at the first iteration, and are statistical significantly worse than the Bayesian hierarchical models.
EM algorithm is a commonly used machine learning technique.
