In structured peer to peer networks, the existing structure enables each peer to find other participating peers in a scalable fashion (e.g., [4]).
In contrast, unstructured peer to peer networks can gracefully accommodate high churn rate [5] but require a separate peer discovery mechanism.
We conclude that a practical solution for peer topeer streaming applications should incorporate the following design properties: (i) it should use an unstructured, multiparent peer to peer overlay, (ii) it should provide a scalable peer discovery mechanism that enables each peer to find its good parents efficiently, (iii) it should detect (and possibly avoid) any shared bottleneck among different connections in the overlay, and (iv) it should deploy congestion controlled connections but ensure in time arrival of delivered segments to each receiver.
Each peer uses the PALS mechanism to stream content from multiple parent peers.
Note that each peer can be both receiver and parent at the same time 4 . Each receiver periodically exchanges messages (i.e., gossips) with other peers in the overlay to learn about those participating peers that are potentially good parents.
Throughout this paper we use receiver and parent as short form for receiver peer and parent peer.
Image maintenance mechanism evicts extra records (beyond img sz) that satisfy one of the following conditions: (i) represent peers with the lower utility, (ii) represent peers that were already dropped by the PS mechanism due to poor performance and (iii) have a timestamp older than a threshold.
Given the available bandwidth from all parents (including the new one) and possible correlation among them, a receiver can use one of the following criteria to drop a parent: (i) to maximize the bandwidth, the receiver can drop the parent that contributes minimum bandwidth, (ii) to maximize path diversity among connections from parents, the receiver should drop the parent that is located behind the same bottleneck with the largest number of active parents and contributes minimum bandwidth among them.
