Recent advances in server virtualization technologies [8, 14, 22] allow for the live migration of services within a local area network (LAN) environment.
When using these technologies in a LAN environment, services execute in a virtual server, and the migration services provided by the underlying virtualization framework allows for a virtual server to be migrated from one physical server to another, without any significant downtime for the service or application.
In order to maintain network level reachability, the IP address(es) associated with the virtual server has to be reachable at the physical server where the virtual server is migrated to.
However, since we propose to use WAN server migration as a means to deal with complete data center outages, these mechanisms are inadequate for our purposes and below we propose extension to remote replication technologies which can work in concert with server migration to minimize service downtime.
From the discussion above, a key requirement for live server migration across a WAN is the ability to have the IP address(es) of the virtual server be reachable at the new data center location immediately after the migration has completed.
Figure 1 shows the environment where the application running in a virtual server VS has to be moved from a physical server in data center A to a physical server in data center B. Prior to the maintenance event, the coordinating migration management system (MMS) would signal to both the server management system as well as the network that a migration is imminent.
Specifically, from this point in time, any traffic destined for the virtual server address that arrives at ¢©¨©¥ will be switched onto the tunnel to ¢©¨©§ for delivery to data center B. Note that at this point, from a server perspective the migration is complete as the VS is now active in data center B.
Recently live WAN migration using IP tunnels was demonstrated in [21], where an IP tunnel is set up from the source to destination server to transparently forward packets to and from the application; we advocate an alternate approach that assumes edge router support.
