They generated snippets from spanning trees of document graphs and experimentally compared these snippets against the snippets generated for the same documents by the Google desktop search system and MSN desktop search system.
Cutrell and Guan [4] conducted an eye tracking study to investigate the influence of snippet length on Web search performance and found that the optimal snippet length varied according to the task type, with longer snippets leading to improved performance for informational tasks and shorter snippets for navigational tasks.
White et al. [17] evaluated three alternatives to the standard Web search interface: one that displays expanded summaries on mouse hovers, one that displays a list of top ranking sentences extracted from the results taken as a group, and one that updates this list automatically through implicit feedback.
The query independent snippets were created by extracting the first few sentences of the articles; the query dependent snippets were created by selecting the highest scoring sentences under a measure biased towards sentences containing query terms.
Agichtein et al. interpreted caption features, clickthroughs and other user behavior as implicit feedback to learn preferences [2] and improve ranking [1] in Web search.
A clickthrough inversion occurs at position N when the result at position N receives fewer clicks than the result at position N + 1. Following Joachims et al. [9], we interpret a clickthrough inversion as indicating a preference for the lower ranking result, overcoming any trust bias.
For twothirds of the inversions (236), the page associated with caption A is at least as relevant as the page associated with caption B. For 28.7% of the inversions, A has greater relevance than B, which received the greater number of clickthroughs.
For missing snippets, a positive pair has the caption missing in caption A (but not B) and a negative pair has the caption missing in B (but not A).
