The final case shows a content manager combined with a policy manager controlling a remote storage manager.
As such the content manager layer provides an API for the application to manipulate all aspects of the Spectrum architecture at different levels of granularity.
The Spectrum architecture has policies that are normally associated with storage that aim to optimize disk usage.
For layers that reside on remote systems (e.g. a remote store) only the meta information needed to contact the remote 7 Content Manager Policy Manager Storage Manager Storage Fetcher Program Listings Graphical User Interface Network Enabled DVR Program Information Content DVR Application Figure 2: Spectrum in a Network Enabled DVR node is stored locally.
The modular/layered design of the Spectrum architecture simplifies the objective of distribution of functionality.
If the policy manager is using an external storage manager (e.g. a storage appliance), then the media files are stored remotely and are only remotely referenced by the policy manager.
Unlike the Spectrum architecture which allows edge devices to operate in a largely autonomous fashion, the vendor solutions typically are more tightly coupled to a centralized controller and do not have the sophisticated time based operations offered by Spectrum.
Finally, the modular design of the Spectrum architecture allows both stand alone and distributed realizations so that the system can be deployed in a variety of applications.
