Introduction The graph coloring problem is to assign colors to vertices of a graph G such that no two adjacent vertices receive the same color ; such a coloring is referred to as a legal coloring of G .
The minimum number of colors required to do a legal coloring is known as the chromatic number of G , and is denoted ( G ) .
However , none of these inapproximability results apply to the case when the input graph is k - colorable for some small constant k. Indeed , better performance guarantees are known in this case .
An important distinguishing aspect of our proof is that it does not require the PCP theorem and only relies on the NP - hardness of the MAX CLIQUE problem .
In light of our main result , it is natural to ask how far non PCP techniques can go in proving hardness results for coloring 3 - colorable graphs .
r Figure 1 : High - level structure of each T i 2 Proof of the Main Theorem We describe a reduction from the INDEPENDENT SET problem .
This is because the starting point for Theorems 2 and 3 are INDEPENDENT SET instances that are generated by PCP constructions and k is a suitably large constant in this case .
Consider again the schematic in Figure 3 and assign the following interpretation to the node labels : Colors in the first coordinate of each node correspond to the situation where
