Optimal Time Bounds for Approximate Clustering .
Introduction Given a set of points and pairwise distances between the points , the goal of clustering problems is to partition the points into a number of sets such that points in each set are " close " with respect to some objective function .
Clustering algorithms are widely used to organize large data sets in areas such as data mining and information retrieval .
For example , we may wish to partition a set of web logs to infer certain usage patterns , or divide a corpus of documents into a small number of related groups .
Given a set of points and associated interpoint distances , let the median of the set be the point in the set that minimizes the sum of distances to all other points in the set .
We ask the following natural question : Does allowing inputs with arbitrary point weights incur a substantial time penalty ?
We note that even for moderate weights , say O ( n 2 ) , the naive approach of viewing a weighted point as a collection of unit - weight points increases the input size dramatically .
The algorithm succeeds with high probability , that is , for any positive constant , we can adjust constant factors in the definition of the algorithm to achieve a failure probability less than n .
