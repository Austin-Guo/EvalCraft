Given a cache and a sequence of requests for files of uniform sizes , a system has to satisfy the requests one by one .
The paging problem is also known as caching if the files have nonuniform size and retrieval cost .
Hence , many results for tree metrics imply corresponding results for arbitrary metric spaces with an additional logarithmic factor .
Most existing work on these problems focuses on upper bound results , and lower bound results only apply to algorithms without a capacity blowup .
As an example , consider a simple two - level hierarchy associated with equal - sized departments within a university .
Suppose the down loop takes the second branch of the outer if state - ment .
We initialize POFF to an arbitrary consistent placement with associated coloring COFF .
DISCUSSION Cooperative caching has in fact found its application in areas other than distributed systems .
