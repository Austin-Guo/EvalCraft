Graph coloring abstracts the problem of assigning registers to live ranges in a program into the problem of assigning colors to nodes in the interference graph .
Section briefly reviews the graph - coloring register allocation and Section 3 describes previous coalescing heuristics on the graph - coloring framework .

A long live range is split into shorter ones by copies and load / stores inserted at carefully selected places .

The register allocation problem in this context is highly challenging because aggressive code scheduling in the presence of complex control flows generates many copies and increases the register pressure .
The machine has general - purpose registers and 16 condition registers which are targeted for both scheduling and register allocation For aggressive scheduling , the compiler re
