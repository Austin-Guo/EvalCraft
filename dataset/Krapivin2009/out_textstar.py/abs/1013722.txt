The following standard result shows that deterministic processing cannot increase the relative entropy between two distributions.
Lemma 1.
Theorem 3.
The one-bit message stegosystem described above isln 2 secure against passive adversaries.
Proof.
As already mentioned in the Introduction, the assumption of a fixed covertext distribution seems to render our model somewhat unrealistic for the practical purposes of steganography.
But what are the alternatives?
