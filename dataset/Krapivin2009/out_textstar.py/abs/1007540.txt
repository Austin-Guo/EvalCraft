Our experiments (Section evaluate another domain: controllers for autonomous robots in a combat simulation.
Routers.
For instance, some vocoders work best in noiseless environments or for voices with low pitch; others lock onto a single voice, so they are poor for conference calls, music, and the like.
A software radio may be able to match observations of its current state against reference observations made under known operating conditions to detect when it is operating in a new environment (e.g., a room containing heavy electrical machinery), being subject to a malicious attack (e.g., jam- ming), or encountering a program bug (e.g., caused by a supposedly benign software upgrade).
A different implementation of program steering would not have required this refactoring step.
We hypothesize that mode identification, and refactoring if necessary, would have been relatively easy for the original authors of the code.
It was harder for us, but still no more than a few hours of work.
