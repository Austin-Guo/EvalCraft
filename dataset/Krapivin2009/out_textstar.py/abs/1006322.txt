Moreover, the existence of a key that can be used to link together observations across sites is crucial to our approach.
In this case, when we learn a local BN at site B, we would expect a (false) edge from node L to node D, because of the edges in the overall BN and the fact that node E is \hidden" (unobserved) at site B.
This was veried experimentally for the three examples in Section 4.
Currently, we are working towards obtaining bounds for the performance of our collective BN as compared to that obtained from a centralized approach, as a function of the data communication involved.
