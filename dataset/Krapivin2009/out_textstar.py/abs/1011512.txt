The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
We do not have to give up the coloring of the other node, though.
In the context of software pipelining, some of these copies are generated to circumvent cross-iteration register overwrites [14], and are not coalescible due to interferences in the code.
We experiment in this context of eliminating copies generated by instruction scheduling.
Coalescing and Spill Results @@@.
