Operators need to be able to predict the effects of a configuration change before deployment in the live network.
Consider X: The locally-best route is c, which has a higher MED value and the same next-hop AS as d, so eliminate c from the candidates at router X .
Consider Y : The locally-best route is d. No other router has a locally-best route with smaller MED value and the same next-hop AS, so mark d as the best route and eliminate b.
Consider X: The locally-best route among the remaining candidates is a, and no other routers have routes left, so mark a as a best route.
Finally, we describe how the emulator can quickly predict the effects of incremental configuration changes.
