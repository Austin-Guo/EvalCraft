More precisely, the following exact security result holds.
Theorem 1.
On query to the decryption oracle, decryption oracle simulation DS looks at each query-answer G-List and (ffi; H H-List.
For each pair taken from both lists, it defines and checks whether As soon as both equalities hold, DS outputs [-] n .
If no such pair is found, "Reject" is returned.
5.1.4 Remarks.
Theorem 8.
