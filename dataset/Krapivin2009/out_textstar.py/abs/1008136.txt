In Section 3 we show how to incorporate implicit restarts, introduced in [35], that permit Lanczos bidiagonalization to maintain limited storage and computational requirements per restart.
In Section 4 we study the use of Ritz and harmonic Ritz values as implicit shifts.
Proposition 3.1 It is not possible, in general, to apply implicit QR steps on the Lanczos factorization (9) of the augmented matrix C, and obtain a Lanczos factorization that can be computed by LBD.
