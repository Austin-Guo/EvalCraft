Besides, we prove some properties about the relationship between metering schemes and secret sharing schemes.
We consider the worst possible case, in which the corrupt servers have collected the maximum possible information in time frames that is, we assume that each server S j in the coalition has been visited by all clients C Therefore, we have to prove that for any subset B of corrupt servers, with cardinality at most s. We need the following result.
Let us consider two linear mappings, us suppose that a vector x is chosen uniformly at random and let us consider the random variables X 0 and X 1 corresponding, 1.
Proof.
If we know the value of x we know that x is any vector with ' 1 are equiprobable.
Then, x 0 can be uniquely determined from x 1 if and only if ' 0 (ker only if .
Besides, there exists a linear secret sharing scheme \Sigma with information rate ae = 2=3.
