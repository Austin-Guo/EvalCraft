We call this property accessibility or realisability.

The following algorithm makes the above construction precise, generating an equivalent unambiguous CTS, from a given CTS and a set of extraction graphs.
Algorithm 1.
J.Burton, M.Koutny and G.Pappalardo Finally, in the present work we build on the preliminary results of [4] (which was based on older implementation relations), and develop e#cient algorithms for automatically verifying the present implementation relation.
