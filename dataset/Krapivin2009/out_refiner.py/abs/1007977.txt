For example, the following relation prefix maps a list to one of its prefixes: prefix :: List A # List A where step :: A # List A # List A step a In each step of the fold we can choose either to cons the current item to some prefix of the sublist, or just return the empty sequence [ ], which is a prefix of every list.
For lists, the Haskell Prelude function List A # B is well known.
A functor on relations that takes functions to functions and is monotonic under relational inclusion is called a relator.
It says that if we have a tree x whose inorder traversal is as, the relation add must be able to create a new tree y out of a and x such that the order traversal of y is a : as.
We therefore conclude that (inorder - roll) 4.2 Enforcing a Preorder Having inverted inorder - roll , we can start the derivation: rebuild x {roll is an isomorphism} {converse is contravariant} {inverting inorder - roll as in the last section} let hasPreorder Except for the introduction of roll , the derivation so far is mostly mechanical.
They are defined by: lbr (a, rbr (a, In words, step extends a forest in one of the four possible ways, when applica- ble: adding a new tip tree, extending the left-most tree in the forest by making it a left-subtree or a right-subtree, or combining the two left-most trees.
The notion of F-well-foundedness is defined in [13, page 102] as relation R is F-well-founded if and only if, for all relations T , the equation has a unique solution for X .
Thanks are due to members of the Algebra of Programming group in Oxford University Computing Laboratory, to Oege de Moor, for his interest, encouragement and comments throughout the development of this paper, and to Roland Backhouse, who kindly pointed out the relation with Henk Doorn- bos's work and the advantage of basing the theorem on F-reductivity.
