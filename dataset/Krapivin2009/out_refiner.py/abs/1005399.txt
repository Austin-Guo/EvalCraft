The turn module commands the robot to make the required turn, then passes the speed on to the forward module which, if not in a halt state, commands the robot to move forward with the specified speed.
As we don't model this layer in this paper (the first two layers are sufficient to demonstrate our proposal), we refer the reader to (Brooks 1986) for details.
Rather, since lower layers are trusted to be autonomous (if the higher layer is not ac- tive, the lower layer will still behave validly) and those layers will have simpler axiomatizations in general, the cycle time to compute their outputs can be shorter than that of higher, more complex layers, leading to an over-all high performance.
We then apply our "as- sumptions" by circumscribing the ab predicates or input predicates for which we enforce the CWA in the theory while varying all other predicates and functions in L.
If we ignore the mechanism that runs behind the scenes for a moment (e.g., ignore the time difference between the theorem provers in different layers) and consider the entire system of layers as one logical theory, we can formalize the logical theory as follows.
The theory is not yet implemented on a physical robot, yet the simulations done on the above-described machine helped us identify some points of difficulty in using a theorem prover for the task of controlling an intelligent agent.
Given a theory made of clauses (not necessarily disjunctive) without quantifiers, the PTTP produces a set of PROLOG-like horn clauses, it makes sure only sound unification is produced and avoids the negation-as-failure proofs that are produced by the PROLOG inference algorithm.
Besides implementing the system on a mobile robot, our future work plan includes expanding the layers described in this paper to contain planning layers, map- creating layers (e.g., creating a map of the world (pos- sibly following the work of Shanahan)), layers that contain beliefs about the world (e.g., we may want to doubt our conclusion that we are in a certain location if we believe that a moment ago we were in a distant location and no reasonable change was done to the world to put us in that new location), etc.
