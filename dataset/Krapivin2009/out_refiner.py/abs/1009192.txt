The graph coloring problem is to assign colors to vertices of a graph G such that no two adjacent vertices receive the same color; such a coloring is referred to as a legal coloring of G.
In contrast the hardness result (for approximating within n  for example) for general graph coloring implies some form of PCP [3]; our result therefore also highlights a qualitative difference between the hardness of general graph coloring and coloring 3-colorable graphs.
As in essentially all previous reductions showing hardness of graph coloring, our reduction too starts from the hardness of INDEPENDENT SET (MAX CLIQUE): it transforms an instance G of INDEPENDENT SET to an instance H of graph coloring such that a large independent set in G translates into a small collection of (in our case three) independent sets in H which together cover all vertices in H .
Note that since such graphs can be colored using O(1) colors (in fact by a simple greedy algorithm, while the best algorithm for general 3-colorable graphs uses 46 colors, this hardness result is stronger than that of Theorem 1.
A node of the tree is called selected if at least one of the three rows in its template has colors which reading from left to right form an even permutation of f1; 2; 3g (i.e the first row has colors 1,2,3; the second one has 2,3,1; or the third one has 3,1,2).
Once again it is completely straightforward to check that the gadget works as desired; for instance for the gadget shown, there exists a valid 3-coloring as long either the third row of the left hand side node is or the first row of the right hand side node is (1; 3; 2) (i.e at least one is not selected), but there is no valid 4-coloring if these rows are colored (3; 1; 2) and (1; 2; are selected).
For every constant t > 1 there exist constants q;  such that given a graph G whose vertices can be partitioned into r cliques each containing exactly q vertices, and in which each vertex has degree at most , it is NP-hard to distinguish between the cases Proof of Theorem 2: We employ (essentially) the same reduction as in the proof of Theorem 1, except that we now start from a hard instance of INDEPENDENT SET as in Proposition 3.1 with a "gap" (in independent set size) of 24.
By a pigeonhole argument, since there are only 24 different colorings of a (labeled) 3-clique using 4 colors, there are at least r=24 of the tree-structures whose ground vertices in rows 1; 2; 3 are colored using the same three colors just label these colors as applying the argument used in the proof of Lemma 2.3 to the subgraph of G induced by the vertices in the r=24 cliques corresponding to these tree-structures, we conclude that if H 0 is 4-colorable, then course in the case when the same coloring used to establish Lemma 2.4 with all copies of the ground vertices being colored as properly implies that H 0 is 3-colorable.
