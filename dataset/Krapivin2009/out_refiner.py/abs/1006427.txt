For example if the device is uniformly distributed across all c cells, c even, and we have at most 2 units of time for paging then the best paging strategy is to page half of the cells in the rst round and when the device is not found in these cells then page the other half in the second round.
The problem becomes interesting when because we are looking for a subset of the cells to be paged in the rst round to minimize the expected number of cells paged until all devices have been found (if they are not located in the cells paged in the rst round then we need to page all the remaining cells).
Observe that by independence Pr [Fr Hence Pr [paging lasts exactly r Since if paging stops in round r we page jS1 cells, the expected number of cells paged until all mobile devices are found is which completes the proof.
Using the above theorem it is strightforward to show that the maximum of a strictly convex function are attained at the boundary of the domain as presented in the next lemma.
The rst derivative of the function f( 3y or Thus if there is extremum in the interior it is for 3 c, where the function achieves the value Now let us consider the values of the function at the boundary.
Consequently by Lemma 3.1 the expected number of cells paged until all mobile devices are found is bounded from below by Suppose that P is a partition of size 2 3 c of the sequence S.
One can easily extend the heuristic presented in Section 5 to form an adaptive strategy where, in each round, we calculate conditional probabilities and based on their values we determine the group of cells to page in the next round using the algorithm presented in Figure 1.
Here we observe that our approximation result generalizes to yield results in this model: we can use Lemma 5.3 to show the existence of an approximate strategy, and in Lemma 5.4 we can limit the range for x accordingly to nd an appropriate strategy.
