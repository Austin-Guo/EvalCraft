Hiding information from active adversaries is a different problem since the existence of a hidden message is publicly known, such as in copyright protection schemes.
If later an illegal copy is found, the copyright owner can identify the buyer by decoding the hidden information ("traitor tracing") [NFC94, PS96, PW97].
Similar to cryptography, it is assumed that the adversary Eve has complete information about the system except for a secret shared by Alice and Bob that guarantees the security.
The entropy of a random variable X with probability distribution PX and alphabet X is defined as The conditional entropy of X conditioned on a random variable Y is denotes the entropy of the conditional probability distribution P XjY =y .
The above model tells us that we obtain a secure stegosystem whenever the stegotext distribution is close to the covertext distribution without knowledge of the key.
The embedding function (if Alice is active) consists of the bitwise XOR of the particular n-bit message e and K, thus and Bob can decode by computing K.
The stegosystem based on Willems' algorithm exploits the fact that the average repetition time of a block Y yields an estimate of its probability since it will converge to P Y (y) \Gamma1 .
However, it seems that the information-theoretic model and other statistical approaches will ultimately be more useful for deriving statements about the security of information hiding schemes-and a formal security notion is one of the main reasons for introducing a mathematical model of steganography.
