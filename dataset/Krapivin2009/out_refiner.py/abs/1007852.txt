Kovalev et.al. [13] visit each vertex connected to at least one invalid element and reposition the vertex directly to a point in its feasible set (or \kernel") to make all connected elements valid.
To overcome the above optimization issues, the objective function proposed by Knupp in [12] has been modied in this work so that it is quadratic and smooth as shown for one element in Figure 5c.
This lack of a solution implies that for the given boundary congura- tion it is not possible for all elements to achieve a volume equal to or greater than .
An originally valid mesh shown in Figure 16a was tangled by a random perturbation of a subset of the interior vertices to result in the mesh shown in  Figure  16b.
Steps of untangling Rayleigh-Taylor simulation mesh (a) Zoom-in of original mesh (nodes connected to invalid elements shown as squares) (b) Mesh after feasible set approach, some elements remain with less than a minimum volume (c) Mesh after optimization, some elements remain with zero volume (d) Mesh after second pass of the feasible set approach, all elements have volume greater than required minimum improved with Reference Jacobian Matrix based optimization procedure [4,5] which seeks to improve the mesh but keep it close to the original mesh required for remapping in ALE simulations.
