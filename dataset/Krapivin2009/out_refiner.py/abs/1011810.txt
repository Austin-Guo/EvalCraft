In Section 6, we obtain the model of conjugating automata by adding a uniform sampling condition on interactions to the assumption that interactions are enabled between all pairs of agents.
A population protocol A stably computes a predicate if and only if its input-output relation is single-valued and for all input assignments x, if the predicate is true of x, then FA (x) is the output assignment that maps every agent to otherwise, FA(x) is the output assignment that maps every agent to 0.
The question of whether the number of 1's is between 15% and 20% of the total population can be expressed as This idea extends to predicates on non-binary input alpha- bets, so that if we can express the predicate that the number of a's, b's, and c's are equal by the expression Theorem 2.
This is done by showing that any A-transition can be simulated by a finite sequence of A # - transitions, involving moving the relevant states to adjacent agents using state swaps (which may require additional transitions to move the batons o# each edge before the states on its endpoints can be swapped), moving the S and R batons onto the adjacent agents, and triggering an A-transition.
To achieve the other operations, we elaborate the zeroing operation as follows: (1) increment each of a collection of other counters for each decrement of the source counter, to copy the source value to these destinations, (2) increment another counter c times for each decrement of the source counter, to multiply the source counter by c, (3) increment another counter once for each c decrements of the source counter, to divide the source counter by c and simultaneously find its value modulo c.
Any agent whose live bit equals 1 begins an initialization phase: it marks the first non-timer agent that it encounters as a timer and attempts to initialize every other agent.
Alternatively, if we consider only the number of interactions in which at least one state changes (which might be correlated with the energy required by the computation), then the bounds can be finite even in the stable computation model, and the expected bounds can be smaller in the conjugating automata model.
