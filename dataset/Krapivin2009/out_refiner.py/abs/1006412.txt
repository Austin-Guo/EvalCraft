In choosing these three search engines, we did not consider NorthernLight because with this search engine, queries, in addition to others, returned links to pages that required some access fee.
Googles results were also retrieved by Netscape, however, at the time of the experiment Netscapes results also included results from di?erent resources.
According to this model each document (down- loaded Web page) is represented as a vector of terms found in the document and each query is represented as a vector of terms found in the information-need speci?cation of the user, i.e., the query, query subject and description, and query search keywords.
In Fig. 2(b) the average precision around DCV ? 20 for each search engine using AWSEEM (50) is displayed with the search engines sorted by their average precision around the same DCV using human-based evaluations.
As we explained before, the relevancy of documents is separately decided by each method, so the H column represents the number of relevant documents in top 20 based on human  Table Number of relevant pages for each query in the top 20 results of each search engine Query AlltheWeb HotBot InfoSeek Lycos MSN NetscapeAltaVista Yahoo 9 Total 134 80 167 115 85 76 118 101 145 95 123 110 70 42 164 134 judgment, likewise the A column represents the results of AWSEEM (100).

AWSEEM at DCV 10, 20 using precision (P@10, P@20) reveal that the top two search engines are Yahoo and AltaVista and the worst performing search engine is Netscape.
The same analysis based on recall at DCV 10 and 20 (R@10 and R@20) for human-based evaluation forms subsets distinguishing between search engines, whereas analysis of AWSEEM cannot statistically distinguish between these search engines for both top 50 and 100 pages.
For example, people or business enterprises may work on the solution of di?erent problems at di?erent time instances; and search engines may change their indexing or ranking strategies, and their Web coverage.
