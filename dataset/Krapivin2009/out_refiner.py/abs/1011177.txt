For one we provide a tool for constructing models for (fragments of) Linear Logic which gives precise control over such properties as classical versus intuitionistic, that is we can choose to have a negation satisfying the usual equations, or not; Preprint submitted to Elsevier Preprint 26 July 2000 products (&) and coproducts () coincide on objects, or not, and similarly for their units; tensor . ) coincide on objects, or not, and similarly for their units.
As objects, we will consider functions is a functor on the category of sets and relations, Rel, A is a set and P is a poset which, as a category, is symmetric monoidal closed.
This looks nice and tidy, but in order to argue that this makes P F Set symmetric monoidal closed we have to use the fact that Rel is compact closed and that every object is isomorphic to its dual.
In the general case, the existence of the one does not imply that of the other| but the latter implies the existence of a natural transformation Adding a couple of innocent conditions linking these transformations with the symmetric monoidal closed structure on the underlying category to make the proposed adjunction work result in the demand that F B) be isomorphic to F F (B) which seems to be too restrictive to be useful.
Since talking about comonoids in this setting only makes sense if P F Set has a tensor product, we will assume for the remainder of this section that P is, in fact, a monoid, and that F satises the conditions which ensure that P F Set is a symmetric monoidal category as per Proposition 3.
The above discussion also answers the question whether our semantics is com- plete, since phase spaces are known to be.
Then _ otherwise Co-products work similarly, only in the last case, the value of Note that the unit for product coincides with that for co-product since the underlying set is empty and the tensor product of the empty set with itself is again the empty set, allowing only one choice for a function to 4.
There is the question whether other models which are mainly 'one-sided' (in that the dual is given internally rather than by a priori making every object a pair, so that the dual can be taken by switching components) can be considered within this framework, like event structures, join-complete semilattices, and other domain theoretic models.
