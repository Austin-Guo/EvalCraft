The perturbation process is repeated and since it is guaranteed that each successive degenerate vertex has fewer active constraints, after a finite number of steps a non-degenerate vertex is reached with an unbounded direction.
The characteristic equation of a general 2 \Theta 2 matrix A is Equations (3) and (4) hold for the two distinct values of -, so it follows that for a suitable 2/6-cycle example we require A 11 +A 1.
If the conditions of Proposition 1 are met and row selection ties are resolved by choosing the largest pivot and the columns are selected in the 2/6-cycle order, then the necessary and sufficient conditions for row 1 to be selected in odd iterations and row 2 in even iterations are 0 ! A 11 and The conditions which guarantee that column 1 is chosen in M (1) by the most negative reduced cost rule rather than column 2 or 3 are A 21 It follows from (7) and (8) that - is negative.
From this and (11) it follows that - must lie in the range A 11 and there is a positive gap between these bounds if and only if A 11 If the left hand inequality in (16) is reversed, then column 2 will be chosen rather than column 1 in M (1) , and if the right hand inequality is reversed, then column 4 will be chosen instead of column 2 in M (2) .
When steepest edge column selection is used on the example in Section 2, column 2 is chosen in T (1) instead of column 1 and in the following iteration the problem is shown to be unbounded so the simplex method terminates in iterations.
We shall now assume that the pivot columns are selected in the 2/6-cycle order and derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for expand to select a pivot in the first row in odd iterations and have a unique pivot in the second row in even iterations.
We shall also show that the min step is taken when the pivot is in row 1 and the full step is taken when the pivot is in row 2.
In iteration 2 - K therefore the pivot in row 2 is not acceptable so the pivot must be in row 1.
