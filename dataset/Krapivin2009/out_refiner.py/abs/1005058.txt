Model-based methods, such as Bayesian networks and Clustering models, approach the problem from a probabilistic perspective to find the best product for a given customer profile [Breese et al., 1998] and need only keep the resulting model in memory while the algorithm runs.
Because memory-based approaches make predictions based on the local neighborhood of the active user and the model-based approach bases its predictions on the similarities between items (products), recommender systems can be grouped into user-based and item-based systems [Sarwar et al., 2001, Sarwar et al., 2000].
There are two internal Verizon datasets and the MSWeb benchmark dataset (provided in [Hettich and Bay, 1999, Breese et al., 1998, Heckerman et al., 2000]) for empirical comparisons of various recommender systems.
But recommender systems are also useful in call centers, where the sta# is not always as experienced or trained in sales as would be ideal and the system could assist the customer service and sales representatives.
Default voting, to assign minimal weights to some items, was proposed in [Breese et al., 1998] as one method to prevent poor performance in the course of intersecting common votes (purchased products) and, instead of the intersection, the union of voted items could be used [Breese et al., 1998].
Our goal in this section is to demonstrate that association mining-based recommender systems are comparable with the well-known recommender system introduced in [Breese et al., 1998, Heckerman et al., 2000] and other item-based recommender systems.
For example, Product 26 in our dataset is not o#ered by the recommender systems in this study, so the test data contains only those transactions that have at least 2 products other than Product 26 before one of the products was removed according to the all-but-1 protocol.
For the WESTDB2 dataset, e-VZpro performed remarkably well (58.7% compared to 41.93%) and its best result, (46.20% compared to 47.59%) for the GENBUS dataset was very close to the result of the dependency networks based recommender system discussed earlier.
