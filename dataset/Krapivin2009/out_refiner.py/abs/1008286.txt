The semantic definition for an action implies that P holds for a trajectory ae over an observation if it holds at the first position of the observation: Each action - has an enabling condition which is a state predicate, denoted by en(-), and is true over a state oe if there is state oe 0 such that (oe; oe 0 ) is a -step: is the set of primed variables in - , which are treated as rigid variables in the above definition.
A timed transition system consists of an underlying transition system and two functions l and u defining the transition time bounds for each transition.
A state predicate P is an invariant of a transition system S if P holds at any position in any interval for all trajectories of S .
An induction rule for proving an invariant of S is given in [MP81] as: which is still S-sound in the interval logical setting, i.e., any transition system satisfying the premises also satisfies the conclusion.
Such a property is specified by a temporal formula of the form P Therefore, to prove a bounded invariance property, we often have to prove a bounded unless property.
The first premise ensures the pattern (dPe ; (d:Pe ; OE)) does not collapse, the premise in the second line says that a /-state sequence pattern can only proceed with P lasting for at least l 1 time units followed by a :P -state and then a OE pattern, the premise in the third line then ensures that :P lasts for at least l 2 time units.
The time transition system GB 1 satisfies the following TLTL properties: proven by applying 3 -SS to - 1 4, with the following premises: obviously valid in the untimed LTL proof system.
The approach in this paper defines DC in terms of trajectories of transition systems and define the satisfaction relation of a duration formula by a transition system.
