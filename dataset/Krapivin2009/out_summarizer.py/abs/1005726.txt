A provider uses the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to exchange reachability information with neighboring domains and to propagate these routes within its own network.
Operators typically handle network engineering tasks by tuning the existing configuration of the live network, witnessing the effects of the change, and reverting to the previous configuration if the desired effects are not achieved.
To ensure that the algorithm is efficient, the best route that the algorithm predicts for each router should not change the predictions made earlier for other routers.
We exploit this observation by applying the algorithm in Section 4.2 only once per ingress router and set of egress routers, rather than once for each ingress router and prefix.
However, in a few cases, the two routers had different routes (i.e., with different AS paths), even though one router apparently learned the route directly from the other; these results are summarized in the "Dif- ferent" column in Table 3.
To verify that the emulator does not incorrectly exclude routes from the set of best eBGP routes, we check that, for each prefix, the best route at each RR appears in the set of best eBGP routes as computed by the emulator 3 .
Routing dynamics can explain these inconsistencies- through manual inspection, we found that, in many cases, the best route at the RR was clearly worse than the routes in the set of best eBGP routes (e.g., the RR's best route had the same local preference but a higher AS path length).
