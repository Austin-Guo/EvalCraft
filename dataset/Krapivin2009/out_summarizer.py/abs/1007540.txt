A router in an ad hoc wireless network may have modes that deal with the failure of a neighboring node (by rebuilding its routing table), that respond to congestion (by dropping pack- ets), that conserve power (by reducing signal strength), or that respond to a denial-of-service attack (by triggering packet filters in neighboring routers).
Robot abilities include sensing nearby terrain and robots, sending and receiving radio messages, carrying and unloading raw materials and other robots, attacking other robots, repairing damage, constructing new robots, traveling, and rebooting in order to load a different control program.
When applied to low-performing programs (such programs had no high-level modes), the results of program steering also performed equally to the original programs, for the modeling step had been unable to make good generalizations.
The lack of documentation and the possibility of subtle interactions (each robot ran in its own virtual machine, so global variables were very frequently used) forced us to take special care not to affect behavior  For each program, we collected training data by running approximately matches against a variety of opponents.
The new mode selector was invoked when the program threw an uncaught exception (which would ordinarily cause a crash and possibly a reboot), when the program got caught in a loop (that is, when a timeout occurred while waiting for an event, or when the program executed the same actions repeatedly without effect), and additionally at moments chosen at random (if the same mode was chosen, execution was not interrupted, which is a better approach than forcing the mode to be exited and then re-entered).

The robots did not authenticate the messages, so different robots received messages specifying different rendezvous points.
Likewise, much research in the AI field that automatically chooses among behaviors focuses on low-level control such as activating a motor rather than selecting a high-level goal; the latter is typically performed by a less adaptive high-level control program (if it is explicit at all).
