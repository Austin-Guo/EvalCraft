All their communication is observed by the adversary (the warden), who will thwart their plan by transferring them to a high-security prison as soon as he detects any sign of a hidden message.
If later an illegal copy is found, the copyright owner can identify the buyer by decoding the hidden information ("traitor tracing") [NFC94, PS96, PW97].
A common model and terminology for information hiding has been established at the 1996 Information Hiding Workshop [Pfi96].
We hope that it can serve also as a starting point for further work to formalize active adversaries or computational security.
Alice can use the techniques described below for embedding information; however, to achieve robustness against active adversaries who modify the image, more sophisticated coding methods are necessary (see e.g. [CKLS96]).
The above model tells us that we obtain a secure stegosystem whenever the stegotext distribution is close to the covertext distribution without knowledge of the key.
The stegosystem based on Willems' algorithm exploits the fact that the average repetition time of a block Y yields an estimate of its probability since it will converge to P Y (y) \Gamma1 .
However, it seems that the information-theoretic model and other statistical approaches will ultimately be more useful for deriving statements about the security of information hiding schemes-and a formal security notion is one of the main reasons for introducing a mathematical model of steganography.
