Finding hypergraph transversals has applications in many areas, for example artificial intelligence and database theory [4].
The particular situation of finding a small transversal in a large rank-3 hypergraph is encountered in computational biology, when computing evolutionary phylogenies [3].
There is a close connection between computing the set of all minimal transversals T r(H) of a hypergraph H and the data mining problem of This research is partially supported by CUGS - National Graduate School in Computer Science, Sweden.
Solving for q, we get one positive solution, and using this solution we get: 6k , and note that the condition that qn is an integer is equivalent to the condition that f(k)\Deltan is an integer.
We consider any reduc- tions, meaning cases which require only one branch to be examined and thus can be implemented without any actual recursion, to occur locally within a node of the tree, so that each node of the branching tree has at least two children.
Another motivation is that it seems natural that having n variables and no 2-edges is slightly more difficult than having n variables and one 2-edge, which is in turn more difficult than two 2-edges, and so on, and that no matter how many 2-edges we have, it is always possible that they are all removed by the single assignment which might lead to a maximally reduced hypergraph with and no 2-edges.
A detailed comparison can of course not be given without a more thorough review of his paper and the problem he is solving, but expressed roughly, where we account for 2-edges according to a non-linear function and have a complexity analysis where only local analysis of each recursion is performed, Kullmann accounts for short clauses (corresponding to our 2-edges) linearly, and instead uses a complicated non-local analysis to get a good upper bound.
The only situation which might temporarily increase F (H) is when some 2-edges are removed by case 1, but this can only occur if H contains at least one loop, and if so, then case will reduce n(H) afterwards, resulting in a reduction of F (H) by at least Case 4: In this case, we need to examine in detail how n and k change in each branch of the branching.
