Note that under this approach one may formalize logics and theories where induction is present within the theory (e.g., induction over the natural numbers in Peano Arithmetic), but induction is not present over the encoded theories.
Current research in this area focuses on appropriate induction principles for logics with higher-order quantication, which support higher-order abstract syntax [11, 21, 29].
Theoretically, our work contributes to answering the question \what is a metalogical framework?" by proposing re ective logical frameworks, whose theories have initial models, as a possible answer.
Re ective metalogical frameworks 2.1 Re ective logics Intuitively, a re ective logic is a logic in which important aspects of its metatheory can be represented at the object level | that is, in the logic.
It is then possible to extend the universal theory so that sound reasoning principles | in particular, induction | for each theory in the logic can be re ected ; that is, sound reasoning principles for each theory can be added to the universal theory.
From the logical point of view, we can think of rewriting logic as a framework logic in which any inference system can be naturally formalized by expressing each inference rule as a (possibly conditional) rewrite rule.
The idea is that the theory T , for which we want to prove inductive theorems, is at the object level; an inference system I for inductive proofs uses T as data and therefore should be specied as a rewrite theory at the metalevel; then, dierent proof tactics to guide the application of the rewrite rules specifying the inference rules in I are strategies that can be represented at the meta-metalevel.
According to our representation of minimal logic in rewriting logic, we can rephrase the deduction theorem in the following terms: for any formulae A and B, if B:Theorem is true in the module MINIMAL extended with the membership axiom mb A:Theorem, then A ! B:Theorem is true in MINIMAL.
