For the construction of the queries we asked our participants??more technically known as subjects??(Fall 2001 students of CS533 students and two professors in the Computer Engineering Department of Bilkent University) to de?ne their information-needs in English.
The topics (number of queries in that topic) are as follows: Computer science (16), education (1), Internet (2), literature (1), music (2), plants (1), sports (1), and travel (1).
In choosing these three search engines, we did not consider NorthernLight because with this search engine, queries, in addition to others, returned links to pages that required some access fee.
Googles results were also retrieved by Netscape, however, at the time of the experiment Netscapes results also included results from di?erent resources.
As we explained before, the relevancy of documents is separately decided by each method, so the H column represents the number of relevant documents in top 20 based on human  Table Number of relevant pages for each query in the top 20 results of each search engine Query AlltheWeb HotBot InfoSeek Lycos MSN NetscapeAltaVista Yahoo 9 Total 134 80 167 115 85 76 118 101 145 95 123 110 70 42 164 134 judgment, likewise the A column represents the results of AWSEEM (100).

For example, people or business enterprises may work on the solution of di?erent problems at di?erent time instances; and search engines may change their indexing or ranking strategies, and their Web coverage.
We would like to thank the Fall 2001 CS533, Information Retrieval Systems, students, and David Davenport of Bilkent University for writing and evaluating the queries used in this study.
