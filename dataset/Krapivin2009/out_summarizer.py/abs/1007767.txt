Introduction Clustering of data is an essential ingredient in many information retrieval systems (e.g., for building and maintaining taxonomies), and plays a central role in statis- tics, pattern recognition, biology, web search engines, distributed networks, and other fields.
The question as to how best to define "the clustering problem" seems to be particularly difficult in large unstructured databases whose members are viewed as points in some high dimensional vector space.
Examples for applications that use such clustering rules include methods for determining consensus in biological sequencing data, and the mutual fragments heuristic for computing traveling salesman tours, see Eppstein [7].
In addition to the afore-mentioned application to hierarchical clus- tering, this graph-theoretic clustering is used by the Alta Vista tm search engine in order to prune identical documents from its world-wide web database [4].
The constraints on the clusters are that (i) the (unweighted graph theoretic) diameter of each each cluster is small (a typical value is O(logn)); (ii) the clusters belong to a small number (again a typical number is O(logn)) of color classes, so that the clusters within each class are disjoint and, (iii) for every point x and all its neighbors are contained entirely in at least one cluster.
Simply stated, any n points in Euclidean space of any dimension d can be probabilistically mapped to an O(log n=ffl 2 ) dimensional space so that no distance is increased and (with high probability) no distance shrinks by more than a factor and this mapping has time complexity O(dn log n=ffl 2 ).
Broder, Glassman, Manasse, and Zweig [4] give a heuristic used in Alta Vista tm that seems to give good running time in practice, but requires quadratic time in the worst case.
Notice that dimension reduction techniques cannot guarantee low distortion unless the dimension reduces to\Omega\Gamma/23 n), for which Chazelle's algorithm is still quadratic.
