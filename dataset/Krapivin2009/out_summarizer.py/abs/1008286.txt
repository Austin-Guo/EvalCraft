In general, a denotational approach reflects the engineering disciplines of requirement specification, system design and verification, while an operational approach reflects the engineering disciplines of component de- sign, refinement, and analysis.
The semantic definition for an action implies that P holds for a trajectory ae over an observation if it holds at the first position of the observation: Each action - has an enabling condition which is a state predicate, denoted by en(-), and is true over a state oe if there is state oe 0 such that (oe; oe 0 ) is a -step: is the set of primed variables in - , which are treated as rigid variables in the above definition.
This case study formulates the safety requirement of a gas burner in terms of a variable Leak denoting an undesirable but unavoidable state which represents the presence of unlit gas.
The timing constraints require transitions to be performed neither too early nor too late; for example, a valve controller should not accept to be opened too quickly or be too slowly in closing.
The first premise ensures the pattern (dPe ; (d:Pe ; OE)) does not collapse, the premise in the second line says that a /-state sequence pattern can only proceed with P lasting for at least l 1 time units followed by a :P -state and then a OE pattern, the premise in the third line then ensures that :P lasts for at least l 2 time units.
For example, the transition system GB 2 in Figure 1 is a refinement of GB 1 . GoIdle; Idle HeatOn; Purge Burn FlOn  Figure  1: A refinement of GB 1 GB 2 has the following phases: Idle: Await heat request with no gas and no ignition.
For the same purpose, Zhou and Hansen [ZH96b] and Xu [Xu97] introduce a dense-chop operator which can define the meaning of the sequential composition of state transitions.
However, in both approaches the intermediate states of a sequentially composite statement are hidden, and thus the semantics of x := is the same as that of x := 3.
