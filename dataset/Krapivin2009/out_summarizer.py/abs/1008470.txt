An election mechanism was proposed by Bolot et al. [BTW94] to elect a small number of receivers and collect from them feedback regarding loss rate and congestion in the multicast group.
A particular example where such algorithms are implemented is the IDMaps project [JJJ As part of this project, measurement stations (Tracers) are installed in various locations in the Internet.
For example, the model where full multiplicity feedback is given matches our model for host feedback.
Note that in the calculation for a certain n we obtain but the rest of the values N n (i); i < n cannot be used to obtain N values A similar system can be defined if one wishes to minimize the number of rounds it takes the system to elect a number of representatives in the desired target range.
Thus, most of the graphs presented in the paper are driven by high 23number of users (n) expected number of rounds, L=U=1, c=1.3 L=4, U=8, c=6.6 L=1, U=8, c=4.3 number of users (n) expected number of messages, L=4, U=8, c=8.5 L=1, U=8, c=5.6 Fig. 4. The basic algorithm: T (n) and N(n) as a function of n confidence simulations where each point is the average of 10,000 runs and in all cases the 1% confidence interval is less than 1%.
For T the penalty of undershoot is two rounds while the penalty of overshoot is one round (T < 2 suggests that in most cases no more than one additional round is needed), thus selecting c at the 2/3 point between L and U , i.e., 2(U L)=3 should most likely lay in the flat region around the optimum.
For this, we use the observation that when the feedback is less than L there is a wasted round in which all the hosts suggest themselves as candi- dates.
To increase the chances of succeeding in the first round one can use the following technique.
