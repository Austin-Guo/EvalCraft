The graph coloring problem is to assign colors to vertices of a graph G such that no two adjacent vertices receive the same color; such a coloring is referred to as a legal coloring of G.
Graph coloring is a fundamental and extensively studied problem, which besides its theoretical significance as a canonical NP-hard problem [17], also arises naturally in a variety of applications including register allocation and timetable/examination scheduling.
The first such result was established by Lund and A preliminary version of this paper appeared in the Proceedings of the 15th Annual IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity, July 2000.
In contrast the hardness result (for approximating within n  for example) for general graph coloring implies some form of PCP [3]; our result therefore also highlights a qualitative difference between the hardness of general graph coloring and coloring 3-colorable graphs.
Note that since such graphs can be colored using O(1) colors (in fact by a simple greedy algorithm, while the best algorithm for general 3-colorable graphs uses 46 colors, this hardness result is stronger than that of Theorem 1.
Once again it is completely straightforward to check that the gadget works as desired; for instance for the gadget shown, there exists a valid 3-coloring as long either the third row of the left hand side node is or the first row of the right hand side node is (1; 3; 2) (i.e at least one is not selected), but there is no valid 4-coloring if these rows are colored (3; 1; 2) and (1; 2; are selected).
For every constant t > 1 there exist constants q;  such that given a graph G whose vertices can be partitioned into r cliques each containing exactly q vertices, and in which each vertex has degree at most , it is NP-hard to distinguish between the cases Proof of Theorem 2: We employ (essentially) the same reduction as in the proof of Theorem 1, except that we now start from a hard instance of INDEPENDENT SET as in Proposition 3.1 with a "gap" (in independent set size) of 24.
By a pigeonhole argument, since there are only 24 different colorings of a (labeled) 3-clique using 4 colors, there are at least r=24 of the tree-structures whose ground vertices in rows 1; 2; 3 are colored using the same three colors just label these colors as applying the argument used in the proof of Lemma 2.3 to the subgraph of G induced by the vertices in the r=24 cliques corresponding to these tree-structures, we conclude that if H 0 is 4-colorable, then course in the case when the same coloring used to establish Lemma 2.4 with all copies of the ground vertices being colored as properly implies that H 0 is 3-colorable.
