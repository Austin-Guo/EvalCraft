Assuming, furthermore, that the CGLS method is terminated at a point such that #z k - z# d#A#x#, the authors conclude that the CGLS method is eventually expected to achieve an approximate solution that is as good as any forward stable method for solving the least squares problem.
This shows that, if the Lanczos relation is known for one system, the iterates of the CGLS method for the damped least squares problem (2.8) can be directly computed from this relation and are, in fact, equal to A multishift CGLS method constructs the orthonormal basis once and at the same time computes (3.4) for the required values of #, of course without storing all Lanczos vectors.
We can obtain the quantities of the Lanczos method in its standard form by using a simple diagonal scaling # k with diagonal elements , which shows that holds with Since the # j are available in the CGLS method, the recurrences in (2.6) can be used as an alternative to applying the Lanczos method to A T A with starting vector A T b at virtually the same cost.
In the case # > k, the matrix is assumed to be applied to the first k elements of the vector and the remaining elements are assumed to be unchanged by the operation.
For future convenience we define and we note that Using this relation and the relations given in Section 4.1, the true residual, corresponding to the normal equations, can be written as We plug in the expression for the perturbation term given by Lemma 4.1 and we arrive at our main relation: with This expression plays a similar role in this section as Proposition 2.2 plays for the analysis of the attainable accuracy of the CGLS method.
This picture shows the behavior that we observed for all our test problems: for small # the error is dominated by the contribution of w (1) and for very large values of #, the contribution of w (2) becomes dominant.
If we define x # k as the iterate computed in an exact conjugate gradient method applied to the matrix A with starting vector b, as defined in Section 5.1, then we can show that Here, we have used, essentially, the same technique as used for bounding the vector w (3) in the case that Hence, we do not expect that rounding errors in the computation of the vector x # have a significant influence on the attainable accuracy of the multishift CGLS method.
Nevertheless, using an extensive rounding error analysis for which exploits the special structure of the perturbation term, we showed that this alternative Lanczos method is desirable in multishift CGLS methods.
