Tree-width is important not only for its theoretical application in the graph minors project, but also for its algorithmic qualities: many problems which are NP-hard for the class of all graphs are solvable in linear time for the class of graphs of tree-width at most k for every fixed k.
The authors [2], generalizing a relaxation of a conjecture in [1], showed that, given any surface, although a graph G embedded on that surface may have arbitrarily large tree-width, G has both a vertex partition and an edge partition into two graphs whose tree-width is bounded by a function depending only on the Euler characteristic of the surface.
The set S of all graphs embedded on a surface is an example of a minor-closed class, that is, if G # S, and H #m G, then H # S. Thomas [9] conjectured that every minor-closed class of graphs, other than the class of all graphs, should have this partition property.
Note also that our definition of outgrowth di#ers from that in [6] in that we allow superedges to be degenerate.
The main step towards proving Theorem 1.2 is finding an edge and a vertex (j 1)-coloring, of a (#, r)-outgrowth (G, H), such that any j colors form a graph with bounded tree-width.
This section establishes a bound on the tree-width of a (#, r, h)-layer in terms of #, r and h. h)-layer is a triple (G, H, #(F )) where H has a special superedge associated other superedge has an associated r- ring; G is obtained from H by replacing superedges by the s-round and r-rings; h)-layer, where F is created by the deletion of #(F ).
Then there exist numbers # and # such that every graph in # has a balanced edge and a vertex l-coloring, such that any j < l colors form a graph with tree-width at most #j Proof.
