Examples, such as Beale's well known example [2], have been constructed to show that this can happen, supported by EPSRC grant GR/J0842 Preprint submitted to Elsevier Preprint 29 September 1996 though such examples do seem to be very rare in practice.
An attempt is made to correct this inconsistency at regular intervals (usually after each reinversion) by doing a reset, in which the basic variable values are recalculated from the values of the nonbasic variables.
All the results here are demonstrated for 2/6-cycle examples, however this property is not needed for the results and indeed 6/6-cycle examples can be formed by perturbing the 2/6-cycle examples given in this paper.
It follows from (2) that if A has real eigenvalues they must both have the value 1, in which case the 2 \Theta 2 matrix polynomial A 2 +A+I has two real eigenvalues of 3 and is therefore non-singular.
From this and (11) it follows that - must lie in the range A 11 and there is a positive gap between these bounds if and only if A 11 If the left hand inequality in (16) is reversed, then column 2 will be chosen rather than column 1 in M (1) , and if the right hand inequality is reversed, then column 4 will be chosen instead of column 2 in M (2) .
When steepest edge column selection is used on the example in Section 2, column 2 is chosen in T (1) instead of column 1 and in the following iteration the problem is shown to be unbounded so the simplex method terminates in iterations.
We shall also show that the min step is taken when the pivot is in row 1 and the full step is taken when the pivot is in row 2.
However the robust bqpd code of Fletcher [4] detects degeneracy at the start of the first iteration, changes to the dual, then does one pivot in the dual after which it finds that the dual is infeasible.
