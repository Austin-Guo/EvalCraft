To overcome the above optimization issues, the objective function proposed by Knupp in [12] has been modied in this work so that it is quadratic and smooth as shown for one element in Figure 5c.
For more complex element types the local function includes the cross product (triple product in 3D) of the edge vectors in each connected element computed at the vertex itself and its edge connected neighbors.
This lack of a solution implies that for the given boundary congura- tion it is not possible for all elements to achieve a volume equal to or greater than .
An originally valid mesh shown in Figure 16a was tangled by a random perturbation of a subset of the interior vertices to result in the mesh shown in  Figure  16b.
Steps of untangling Rayleigh-Taylor simulation mesh (a) Zoom-in of original mesh (nodes connected to invalid elements shown as squares) (b) Mesh after feasible set approach, some elements remain with less than a minimum volume (c) Mesh after optimization, some elements remain with zero volume (d) Mesh after second pass of the feasible set approach, all elements have volume greater than required minimum improved with Reference Jacobian Matrix based optimization procedure [4,5] which seeks to improve the mesh but keep it close to the original mesh required for remapping in ALE simulations.
