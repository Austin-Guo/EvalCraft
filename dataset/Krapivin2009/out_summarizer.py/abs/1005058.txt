Model-based methods, such as Bayesian networks and Clustering models, approach the problem from a probabilistic perspective to find the best product for a given customer profile [Breese et al., 1998] and need only keep the resulting model in memory while the algorithm runs.
But recommender systems are also useful in call centers, where the sta# is not always as experienced or trained in sales as would be ideal and the system could assist the customer service and sales representatives.
In these cases, a recommender system should be designed in accordance with the company's overall marketing strategy and a successful system will also benefit employees by helping them attain larger performance bonuses.
Although "collaborative filtering" was first coined in [Goldberg et al., 1992], communications of the ACM featured several pioneering works in the third issue of Volume 40 [Resnick and Varian, 1997] in 1997, including the GroupLens Project [Konstan et al., 1997], and Siteseer [Rucker and Polanco, 1997].
Default voting, to assign minimal weights to some items, was proposed in [Breese et al., 1998] as one method to prevent poor performance in the course of intersecting common votes (purchased products) and, instead of the intersection, the union of voted items could be used [Breese et al., 1998].
For illustration pur- poses, assume these methods are capable of variable selection and that one of these methods, let's say the probabilistic decision trees, found that X 1 is not a significant predictor of X 3 and X 3 is not a signification predictor of X 1 .
Association mining can also be used to predict certain phenomenon (classification problem); a case study in the telecommunication industry [Ali et al., 1997] uses association mining to predict whether manual assistance will be required for a specific order.
For example, Product 26 in our dataset is not o#ered by the recommender systems in this study, so the test data contains only those transactions that have at least 2 products other than Product 26 before one of the products was removed according to the all-but-1 protocol.
