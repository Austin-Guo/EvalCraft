Such limitations are not crippling if the system designer has fine control over the interactions between agents; even finite-state agents can be regimented into cellular automata with computational power equivalent to linear space Turing ma- chines.
The question of whether the number of 1's is between 15% and 20% of the total population can be expressed as This idea extends to predicates on non-binary input alpha- bets, so that if we can express the predicate that the number of a's, b's, and c's are equal by the expression Theorem 2.
The presence or not of the two batons is used to control what e#ect an interaction has: an interaction that involves no batons swaps the states; an interaction that involves one baton moves the baton; and an interaction that involves both batons simulates a transition in A.
This mechanism assumes that n is at least 4 to give room to move the batons out of the way; smaller n values are handled by a separate protocol running in parallel that overrides the output of the main protocol if it detects n # 3. is the state space of A, D is a default initial state of the baton field, S marks the initiator baton, R marks the responder baton, and - marks a "blank" or absent baton.
To achieve the other operations, we elaborate the zeroing operation as follows: (1) increment each of a collection of other counters for each decrement of the source counter, to copy the source value to these destinations, (2) increment another counter c times for each decrement of the source counter, to multiply the source counter by c, (3) increment another counter once for each c decrements of the source counter, to divide the source counter by c and simultaneously find its value modulo c.
The Chemical Abstract Machine of Berry and Boudol [2] is an abstract machine designed to model a situation in which components move about a system and communicate when they come into contact, based on a metaphor of molecules in a solution governed by reaction rules.
Brand and Zafiropulo [3] define a model of communicating processes consisting of a collection of finite state machines that can communicate via pre-defined FIFO message queues, and focus on general properties of protocols defined in the model, such as the possibility of deadlock or loss of synchronization.
