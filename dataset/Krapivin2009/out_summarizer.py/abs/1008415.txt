The ticketing system must assign a passenger a single seat when that passenger purchases a ticket, without knowing what future requests there will be for seats.
The o-line version of the seat reservation problem can be used to solve the following problems [8]: minimizing spill in local register allocation, job scheduling with start and end times, and routing of two point nets in VLSI design.
The competitive ratio on accommodating sequences for the fair unit price seat reservation problem with 3 seats is at most 1+ 3 , where Proof First we give intervals of length four with a spacing of two, except that the rst interval only has length three, and the last has length one.
The ratio becomes which dominates :The technique of Corollary 2.1 which converts an upper bound for m seats to an upper bound for n seats (n > m) by adding some large requests in the beginning of the sequence, can be applied to any sequence.
So the bounds obtained here are probably irrelevant for this application, but they could be relevant for others such as assigning vacation bungalows.
When the ratio of the number of requests accepted by the on-line algorithm to the number of requests accepted by an optimal o-line algorithm is 5n 9k 9(k mod where the last inequality holds because in general a d < 1 and a < c imply that e+ax+cy e+bx+dy  e+a(x+y) .
