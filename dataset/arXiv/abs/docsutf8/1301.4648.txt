the geological systems such as petroleum reservoirs is investigated by the entropy introduced by tsallis and multiplicative hierarchical cascade model . when non - gaussianity appears , it is sign of uncertainty and phase transition , which could be sign of existence of petroleum reservoirs .
two important parameters which describe a system at any scale are determined ; the non - gaussian degree , @xmath0 , announced in entropy and the intermittency , @xmath1 , which explains a critical behavior in the system .
there exist some petrophysical indicators in order to characterize a reservoir , but there is vacancy to measure scaling information contain in comparison with together , yet . in this article
, we compare the non - gaussianity in three selected indicators in various scales .
the quantities investigated in this article includes gamma emission ( gr ) , sonic transient time ( dt ) and neutron porosity ( nphi ) .
it is observed that gr has a fat tailed pdf at all scales which is a sign of phase transition in the system which indicates high @xmath0 and @xmath1 .
this results in the availability of valuable information about this quantity .
nphi displays a scale dependence of pdf which converges to a gaussian at large scales .
this is a sign of a separated and uncorrelated porosity at large scales . for the dt series , small @xmath1 and @xmath0 at all scales
are a hallmark of local correlations in this quantity .
