the nondetection of neutrinos coming from gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) by the icecube experiment has raised serious questions on our understanding of grb s and the mechanism of neutrino flux production in them .
motivated by this and the need for a precise calculation for grb neutrino flux , here we study the effects of beyond standard model physics on the grb neutrino flux . in the internal shock model of grb , high energy neutrinos are expected from muon , pion and kaon decays . using the latest best fit neutrino oscillation parameters , we compute the expected flux on earth for standard as well as non - standard oscillation scenarios . among the non - standard scenarios , we consider neutrino decay , pseudo - dirac nature of neutrinos and presence of one ev scale light sterile neutrino . incorporating other experimental bounds on these new physics scenarios ,
we show that neutrino decay scenario can significantly alter the neutrino flux on earth from the expected ones whereas the corresponding changes for pseudo - dirac and sterile neutrino cases are moderate .
