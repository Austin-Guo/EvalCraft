multiview video has recently emerged as a means to improve user experience in novel multimedia services .
we propose a new stochastic model to characterize the traffic generated by a multiview video coding ( mvc ) variable bit rate source . to this aim
, we resort to a poisson hidden markov model ( p - hmm ) , in which the first ( hidden ) layer represents the evolution of the video activity and the second layer represents the frame sizes of the multiple encoded views . we propose a method for estimating the model parameters in long mvc sequences . we then present extensive numerical simulations assessing the model s ability to produce traffic with realistic characteristics for a general class of mvc sequences .
we then extend our framework to network applications where we show that our model is able to accurately describe the sender and receiver buffers behavior in mvc transmission .
finally , we derive a model of user behavior for interactive view selection , which , in conjunction with our traffic model , is able to accurately predict actual network load in interactive multiview services .    digital video broadcasting , three dimensional tv , hidden markov models , multiview video .
