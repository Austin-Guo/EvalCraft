transporting solids of different sizes is an essential process in the evolution of protoplanetary disks and planet formation .
large solids are supposed to drift inward ; high - temperature minerals found in comets are assumed to have been transported outward . from low - gravity experiments on parabolic flights we studied the light - induced erosion of dusty bodies caused by a solid - state greenhouse effect and photophoresis within a dust bed s upper layers .
tje gravity levels studied were 0.16@xmath0 , 0.38@xmath0 , 1@xmath0 , and 1.7@xmath0 .
the light flux during the experiments was 12 @xmath1 2 kw m@xmath2 and the ambient pressure was 6 @xmath1 0.9 mbar .
light - induced erosion is strongly gravity dependent , which is in agreement with a developed model .
in particular for small dusty bodies ( ( sub)-planetesimals ) , efficient erosion is possible at the optically thin inner edges of protoplanetary disks .
light - induced erosion prevents significant parts of a larger body from moving too close to the host star and be being subsequently accreted .
the small dust produced continues to be subject to photophoresis and is partially transported upward and outward over the surface of the disk ; the resulting small dust particles observed over the disk s lifetime .
the fraction of eroded dust participates in subsequent cycles of growth during planetesimal formation .
another fraction of dust might be collected by a body of planetary size if this body is already present close to the disk edge . either way ,
light induced erosion is an efficient recycling process in protoplanetary disks .
