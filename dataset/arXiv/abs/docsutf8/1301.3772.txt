we present an overview of recent developments in numerical relativity studies of higher dimensional spacetimes with a focus on time evolutions of black - hole systems .
after a brief review of the numerical techniques employed for these studies , we summarize results grouped into the following three areas : ( i ) numerical studies of fundamental properties of black holes , ( ii ) applications of black - hole collisions to the modeling of trans - planckian scattering , ( iii ) numerical studies of asymptotically anti - de sitter spacetimes in the context of the gauge - gravity duality .
