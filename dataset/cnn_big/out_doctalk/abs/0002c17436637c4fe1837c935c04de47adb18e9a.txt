I was asked to diagnose and treat Harry to support a claim explaining why he was unable to show up in a small claims court case , ' Stancheva told CNN in a phone interview .
' The diagnosis was spelled out in a letter she wrote for the small claims court case , Stancheva said .
Burkhart kept his eyes closed and remained limp during most of his hearing , requiring sheriff 's deputies to hold him up .
Cooley called it almost attempted murder , ' because people were sleeping in apartments above where Burkhart allegedly set cars on fire with incendiary devices placed under their engines .
The criminal complaint filed Wednesday also alleged that the fires were caused by use of a device designed to accelerate the fire , ' Cooley said .
If found true , the allegation could mean additional custody time for the defendant .
The vast majority of these fires occurred late at night when the occupants of the apartment buildings were asleep .
The charges include an allegation that she failed to pay for a breast enhancement operation performed on her in 2004 , Meilinger said .
