Obama sent a letter to the heads of the House and Senate on Saturday night , hours after announcing that he believes military action against Syrian targets is the right step to take over the alleged use of chemical weapons .
The proposed legislation from Obama asks Congress to approve the use of military force to deter , disrupt , prevent and degrade the potential for future uses of chemical weapons or other weapons of mass destruction .
But who used the weapons in the reported toxic gas attack in a Damascus suburb on August 21 has been a key point of global debate over the Syrian crisis .
Top U.S. officials have said there 's no doubt that the Syrian government was behind it , while Syrian officials have denied responsibility and blamed jihadists fighting with the rebels .
British and U.S. intelligence reports say the attack involved chemical weapons , but U.N. officials have stressed the importance of waiting for an official report from inspectors .
Our fear now is that the lack of action could embolden the regime and they repeat his attacks in a more serious way , ' said spokesman Louay Safi .
An influential lawmaker in Russia which has stood by Syria and criticized the United States had his own theory .
An anchor on Syrian state television said Obama appeared to be preparing for an aggression on Syria based on repeated lies .
