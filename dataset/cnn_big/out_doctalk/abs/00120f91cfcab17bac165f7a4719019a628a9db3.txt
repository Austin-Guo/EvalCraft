' The correspondent , who 's been covering the battle of Tripoli , walked down steps into a pitch dark tunnel and used a flashlight to navigate an underworld described as massive . '
The tunnel network is believed to extend all the way to the city 's international airport and the Rixos hotel .
That 's where 33 journalists and two foreign nationals were held for five days by pro Gadhafi forces .
The tunnels Sidner saw are wide enough for adults to walk side by side .
She spotted a golf cart that can easily fit in the corridors .
Sidner also saw a range of other sights as she strolled through the labyrinth : A thick wall , a massive door and a sturdy lock .
A charred ceiling , couches and beds where a fire apparently occurred .
A section where NATO bombs fell and the roof caved in .
