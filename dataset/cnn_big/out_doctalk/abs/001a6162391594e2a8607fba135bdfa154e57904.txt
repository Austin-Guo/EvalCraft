The study is merely the latest to cast doubt on the mental benefits of the omega 3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid LRB DHA RRB , which until recently was considered a promising way to minimize the risk and damage of dementia .
Research on DHA has been inconclusive and sometimes conflicting .
Several studies that followed large groups of people as they aged have suggested that a diet rich in fish is linked to a reduced risk of dementia and mental decline , but most randomized controlled trials comparing DHA supplements with placebo have found no benefit .
Quinn and his colleagues randomly assigned about 400 women and men in their mid 70s with likely Alzheimer 's disease the disease is very difficult to accurately diagnose to take 2 grams of DHA or placebo capsules per day .
After 18 months , the average mental decline in the DHA and placebo groups was nearly identical , as measured on two separate tests and rating scales .
Despite the disappointing results , the study does n't entirely rule out the possibility that DHA may have some benefit if taken earlier in life .
A growing body of research suggests that dementia begins decades before any noticeable symptoms surface , and it 's possible that DHA helps prevent or slow those harmful changes .
