U.S. District Court Judge Rosemary Collyer expressed concern that the initial mental exam , ordered by a magistrate judge , was done before she had a chance to hear a legal motion by the defense disputing whether the magistrate had the authority to order it .
The 60 minute initial mental examination of Gonzalez at the District of Columbia jail came as a surprise to the judge and to both the government and defense .
' Nonetheless , he withdrew his objections and agreed to allow his client to undergo a fuller competency examination to try to undo the results of the initial examination .
The judge delayed arraignment for Gonzalez on new charges the government filed against him last week .
Gonzalez was arrested in September after he allegedly jumped the White House fence and sprinted into the executive mansion , setting off concerns about Secret Service security procedures .
The judge also raised concerns that the government 's handling of previous unrelated cases could mean it will take some time for Gonzalez to be examined at a federal Bureau of Prisons facility .
She gave one example of an unnamed defendant who sat at the District of Columbia jail for months before anyone noticed he had n't received the tests that were ordered .
The problem , she said , was that sequestration has cut resources for the Bureau of Prisons and finding a bed can take time .
