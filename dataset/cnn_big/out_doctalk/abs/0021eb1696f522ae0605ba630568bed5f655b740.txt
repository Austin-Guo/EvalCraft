The Cold War aerial games of chicken portrayed in the movie Top Gun ' are happening in real life again nearly 30 years later .
The U.S. plane had been flying in international airspace , conducting an electronic eavesdropping mission on the Russian military , when the Russians took the unusual action of beginning to track it with land based radar .
The spy plane crew felt so concerned about the radar tracking that it wanted to get out of the area as quickly as possible , the official said .
As a result of this incident , the United States is discussing the matter with Sweden and letting officials know there may be further occurrences where American jets have to divert so quickly they may not be able to wait for permission .
Russian officials did not provide any immediate reaction about the encounter .
This was at least the second potentially dangerous encounter between a U.S. plane and Russia over the past few months .
But the official said the land radar activity by the Russians in this instance was unusual .
Pro Russia rebels have denied allegations from Ukraine and the West that they shot down the Malaysian airliner , or that Russia supplied equipment used to shoot it down .
