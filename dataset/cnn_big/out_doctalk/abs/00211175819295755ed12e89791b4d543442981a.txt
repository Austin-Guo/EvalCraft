U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis said the city needs to comprehensively reassess its policies and practices , to analyze the evidence showing the effect of those policies and practices , and to rationally consider how they can be changed to achieve a firefighter hiring process that is in actual practice and effect fair and open to all .
' The order requires the city to take remedial steps to fix discriminatory hiring practices and puts the court monitor in place for at least the next 10 years to make sure those steps are taken .
The City 's senior leaders have routinely denied that they are responsible or doing anything to remedy nearly forty years of discrimination .
I think it 's fair to say no previous administration has done more or been as successful in attracting the diversity to the FDNY than we have , ' the mayor told reporters Wednesday , and I could n't feel more strongly about it . '
Bloomberg said 61,000 people , more than half of them minorities , applied to the fire department in the last recruiting campaign , shattering any previous record for minority applicants .
' Garaufis acknowledged that the city has improved its minority recruiting , but he said the subsequent hiring processes and discriminatory testing procedures ' have kept many of these minorities from actually being hired .
We 're glad to see the judge properly addressing this issue .
