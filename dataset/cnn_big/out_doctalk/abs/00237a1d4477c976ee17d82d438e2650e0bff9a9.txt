Our rocket crew is ready , ' continued Nkoloso , explaining that his aspiring troupe of space explorers had been gearing up for their interstellar journey in the headquarters of the academy he 'd set up on the outskirts of Zambian capital Lusaka .
He 'd also been training his would be astronauts by rolling them down a hill in oil drums , a technique aimed at getting his team acclimatized to the weightlessness experienced during space travel .
In the self published book , De Middel self consciously conjures up the story of the unofficial space program piece by piece .
She uses a series of cinematographic images , including staged depictions of discarded oil barrels , makeshift spaceships , elephant hugging spacemen and flying cats , as well as vintage looking maps , documents and newspapers cuttings .
Throughout , facts and fiction are intertwined as part of an intriguing narrative which challenges viewers perceptions about what 's real and what 's not .
Her speculative pictures exude a feeling of nostalgia and sympathy , celebrating the audacious and naive spirit of a past era where grandiose dreams were not limited by circumstances .
For models , she relied on social media and friends ; for the astronauts helmets , she used old domes of street lights ; and for the flashy spacesuits , she employed the sewing talents of her grandmother .
She 's been contacted by Nigeria 's space program and been invited to the continent to give talks , while her book is being shown in South Africa and Senegal .
