The grisly discovery , which came after teams of people searched for the child , marks the 15th victim in the past 15 months in that remote district in western Nepal .
The police chief suspects that a single man eating leopard is responsible for the deaths .
Maheshwor Dhakal , an ecologist at the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation in Kathmandu , agreed that it is unusual to find more than one or two man eating animals in one area .
More human victims could also be expected if there were more than one or two man eaters around , he said .
Since human blood has more salt than animal blood , once wild animals get the taste of salty blood they do not like other animals like deer , ' Dhakal said .
The others are older children and a 29 year old woman who had gone to collect fodder for domestic animals in the nearby forest , a common practice in Nepal .
The local administration has sought to raise public awareness of the dangers of going alone into nearby forests and has mobilized the police , armed police force and local people who have licensed guns to hunt for the animal .
' The chief district administrator has granted permission for this particular leopard to be killed .
