Nothing but a group of men dressed in space suit like outfits , cautiously throwing the dead body into the grave , they pause only to toss in anything else they are wearing that came into contact with the deceased .
These men are part of the country 's Ebola response team , specifically tasked with burying anyone suspected to have died of the Ebola virus .
The virus is spread through contact with the blood and body fluids of people infected with Ebola , and it is still transferable even from a dead body .
Now almost anytime there is a suspected Ebola death in the community , they call in the Ebola response team to come and bury the body safely .
It may not have been from the deadly virus , but the villagers are not taking any chances .
Some of the residents abandoned the town in such a hurry that their clothes and floor mats have been left hanging on clotheslines .
Several times I dream I become infected , I see myself in the case management center .
These positive outcomes keep Tamba hopeful as he and other health workers continue to tirelessly explain to the community how to prevent infection .
