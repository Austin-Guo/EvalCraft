The finals will be a great celebration of football across the European continent , and the 60th anniversary edition will be truly special , by really coming to the doorstep of all football fans .
It would be great to see England playing in front of their home fans here in London as part of a EURO Finals tournament but many countries have also put themselves forward as hosts and we expect this to be a very competitive bidding process .
UEFA says all 32 associations can submit a maximum of two bids one which covers three group matches and one knockout round and another which will vie to host the semifinal and final .
