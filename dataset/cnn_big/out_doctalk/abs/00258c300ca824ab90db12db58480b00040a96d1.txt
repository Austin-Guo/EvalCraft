The candlelight vigil comes after recent efforts by the Chinese government to quash would be demonstrators from holding anti government protests .
About 26 people were arrested between February and March , according to a Hong Kong based human rights group , when an anonymous group began an internet campaign calling for anti government protests in China similar to ones that have taken hold in the Middle East .
In response to the campaign , authorities deployed heavy security along major thoroughfares , especially in Wangfujing , a busy shopping street in downtown Beijing that had been designated by the online group for protests .
He was fired as Communist Party chief in 1987 by Deng Xiaoping for pushing policies deemed too soft toward bourgeois liberal ideas ' and tolerating student protests .
The April 15 memorial quickly turned into a pro democracy movement , and students held talks with the government and later a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square to press their cause .
The soldiers , on strict orders to clear the square of demonstrators , had forced their way through the city 's main thoroughfare .
Along the way , they met fierce resistance from students and city residents who barricaded the streets , so they fired at them .
When the firing stopped , hundreds if not thousands of people lay maimed or dead .
