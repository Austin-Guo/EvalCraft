Specifically , the school adopted a new policy this week that prohibits romantic relationships between undergraduates and professors .
The previous policy only did so between professors and the students they taught .
Harvard released a statement saying a specially appointed committee determined that the existing language on relationships of unequal status did not explicitly reflect the faculty 's expectations of what constituted an appropriate relationship between undergraduate students and faculty members .
therefore , the committee revised the policy to include a clear prohibition to better accord with these expectations .
Harvard responded at the time by saying it had appointed its first ever Title IX officer , and that the school 's president recently announced the creation of a university wide task force composed of faculty , students and staff that will recommend how we can better prevent sexual misconduct at Harvard .
