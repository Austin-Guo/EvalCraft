LRB CNN RRB The attorney for a suburban New York cardiologist charged in what authorities say was a failed scheme to have another physician hurt or killed is calling the allegations against his client completely unsubstantiated .
It does n't matter what anyone says , he is presumed to be innocent .
This man , while he was in a detention cell , the only thing that he cared about were his patients .
The investigation began back in December , when undercover officers began buying heroin and oxycodone pills from Moschetto in what was initially a routine investigation into the sale of prescription drugs , officials said .
During the course of the undercover operation , however , Moschetto also sold the officers two semiautomatic assault weapons as well as ammunition , prosecutors said .
Moschetto allegedly told officers during one buy that he needed dynamite to blow up a building .
Moschetto allegedly gave an informant and undercover detective blank prescriptions and cash for the assault and killing of the fellow cardiologist , according to prosecutors .
He also requested that the rival 's wife be assaulted if she happened to be present , authorities said .
