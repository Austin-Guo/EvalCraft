Tripoli , Libya  LRB  CNN  RRB     Rebels in Tripoli furiously hunting for signs of longtime Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi are exploring a network of tunnels and bunkers built beneath his massive compound .
CNN 's Sara Sidner got a peek at the passageways Friday .
That 's where 33 journalists and two foreign nationals were held for five days by pro Gadhafi forces .
It also is thought to extend to a neighborhood where Gadhafi forces were lobbing shells recently toward the compound after it was taken over by the rebels .
The tunnels Sidner saw are wide enough for adults to walk side by side .
Sidner also saw a range of other sights as she strolled through the labyrinth : A thick wall , a massive door and a sturdy lock .
Another room contained videotapes lined up on a shelf , part of a TV studio where Gadhafi may have recorded messages .
It 's set up like a survival bunker , ' Sidner said in an on air report .
