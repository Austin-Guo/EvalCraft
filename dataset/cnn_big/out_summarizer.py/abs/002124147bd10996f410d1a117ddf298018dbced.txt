The sickening execution , recorded and released online for the world to see , came with a warning to the U.S. : ISIS showed another captive American journalist , believed to be Steven Sotloff , and threatened to kill him too if the U.S. does not stop helping those fighting to stop ISIS advances .
First , obviously , it can not give into ISIS threats and must continue helping dislodge ISIS from northern Iraq where it is engaging in ethnic cleansing against Christians and other minorities ; kidnapping , raping and selling women ; and massacring people .
Before ISIS , we knew that human beings are capable of unspeakable brutality .
ISIS is not the first to murder victims in large numbers ; it is not the first to kill those who disagree with its beliefs or who belong to different ethnic or religious groups .
ISIS views the videos of mass executions , of severed heads on poles and of crucified men , as a way to keep its enemies frightened and weakened , and a way to tell prospective recruits that it is fearless in its war to create an Islamic caliphate ruling over all the world 's Muslims .
Graduates of the Syria war , from where ISIS pushed into Iraq , have killed in Europe .
Last month , ISIS flags flew in an anti Israel demonstration in the Hague , chanting against America and the West and most enthusiastically ,    Death to the Jews . ' 
ISIS can simply not be allowed to keep a foothold in the Middle East .
It is politically and strategically complicated , because ISIS is also fighting Syrian President Bashar al Assad and Hezbollah , and defeating ISIS would also be enormously pleasing to Iran .
