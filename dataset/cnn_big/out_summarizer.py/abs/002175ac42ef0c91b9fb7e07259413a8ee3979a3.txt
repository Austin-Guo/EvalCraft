In a deserted playground a few hundred miles south of Cairo , 13 year old Asmaa Ashraf fiddles with a broken rusted slide .
Two and a half years after the country 's uprising began , Egypt 's fledgling democracy is stillborn , stubbornly stuck between its past and future .
And as the government struggles to wade through the country 's protracted political problems , Egypt 's festering education system is orphaned    even though , with a growing youth population , it 's key to the country 's future .
In the World Economic Forum 's latest report on global competitiveness , Egypt ranked near the bottom    131st out of 144 countries    for quality of primary education .
Meanwhile , a report by London think tank Chatham House says just $ 129 a year is spent on each Egyptian student ; the United States , for example , spends 40 times as much .
This year , a few Egyptian entrepreneurs have launched Nafham , a Web based startup that features crowd sourced educational videos .
Another innovative initiative is Teach for Egypt , a start up created by Nada Ramadan , a 24 year old Egyptian who 's a graduate student at Georgetown University in Washington .
Based on the Teach for America model , Ramadan plans to recruit ambitious college graduates    most from within the Egyptian community and diaspora    to commit to a two year service in which they are trained extensively and placed in underprivileged schools .
