A young girl with brown eyes and long brown hair , wearing a simple white shirt , poses the question .
Behind her is a small army of child actors who star in the video , which is cute for a moment , but deadly serious .
In reality , the video is not reflecting anything that people have not experienced , ' said Rosenda Martinez , a spokeswoman for Our Mexico of the Future , the group behind the production .
The video targets the major presidential candidates    Enrique Pena Nieto , Josefina Vazquez Mota and Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador    and aims to raise awareness about Our Mexico of the Future .
The goal of the organization is to collect as many    visions ' of Mexico 's future as possible and to compile them in a book that will be presented to the candidates before the election .
Vazquez Mota , of the ruling National Action Party , said the video 's message ca n't go unnoticed , while Institutional Revolutionary Party candidate Pena Nieto expressed that now is the time for change , as the video suggests .
Leftist candidate Lopez Obrador , of the Party of the Democratic Revolution , had not seen the video , but said he agreed with the theme of change .
