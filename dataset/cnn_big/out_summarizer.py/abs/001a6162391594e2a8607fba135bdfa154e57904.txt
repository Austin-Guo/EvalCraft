An essential nutrient found in fish oil does not appear to slow the mental decline associated with Alzheimer 's disease , according to a new study in the Journal of the American Medical Association .
The study is merely the latest to cast doubt on the mental benefits of the omega 3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid  LRB  DHA  RRB  , which until recently was considered a promising way to minimize the risk and damage of dementia .
Fish oil    seems to be healthy in general , and maybe for other things it 's helpful , but it does n't benefit cognitive function in a person with Alzheimer 's , ' says Ferris , who was not involved in the study .
Several studies that followed large groups of people as they aged have suggested that a diet rich in fish is linked to a reduced risk of dementia and mental decline , but most randomized controlled trials comparing DHA supplements with placebo have found no benefit .
It 's not the first time something in large epidemiological datasets just did n't work out clinically , ' Ferris says , noting that statin medications , anti inflammatory drugs , and estrogen therapy have all failed to live up to their initial promise in preventing or treating Alzheimer 's .
Quinn and his colleagues randomly assigned about 400 women and men in their mid 70s with likely Alzheimer 's disease    the disease is very difficult to accurately diagnose    to take 2 grams of DHA or placebo capsules per day .
A growing body of research suggests that dementia begins decades before any noticeable symptoms surface , and it 's possible that DHA helps prevent or slow those harmful changes .
Effective treatment strategies to prevent progression of  LSB  Alzheimer 's disease  RSB  will likely need to be initiated earlier , ' Yaffe writes in an editorial accompanying the study .
