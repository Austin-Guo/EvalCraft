LRB  CNN  RRB     Usain Bolt rounded off the world championships Sunday by claiming his third gold in Moscow as he anchored Jamaica to victory in the men 's 4x100m relay .
The 26 year old Bolt has now collected eight gold medals at world championships , equaling the record held by American trio Carl Lewis , Michael Johnson and Allyson Felix , not to mention the small matter of six Olympic titles .
Victory was never seriously in doubt once he got the baton safely in hand from Ashmeade , while Gatlin and the United States third leg runner Rakieem Salaam had problems .
Earlier , Jamaica 's women underlined their dominance in the sprint events by winning the 4x100m relay gold , anchored by Shelly Ann Fraser Pryce , who like Bolt was completing a triple .
Their quartet recorded a championship record of 41.29 seconds , well clear of France , who crossed the line in second place in 42.73 seconds .
Defending champions , the United States , were initially back in the bronze medal position after losing time on the second handover between Alexandria Anderson and English Gardner , but promoted to silver when France were subsequently disqualified for an illegal handover .
Germany 's Christina Obergfoll finally took gold at global level in the women 's javelin after five previous silvers , while Kenya 's Asbel Kiprop easily won a tactical men 's 1500m final .
Bolt 's final dash for golden glory brought the eight day championship to a rousing finale , but while the hosts topped the medal table from the United States there was criticism of the poor attendances in the Luzhniki Stadium .
