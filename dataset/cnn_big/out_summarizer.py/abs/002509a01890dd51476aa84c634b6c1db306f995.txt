The case concerns the torture of Ogoni leaders in Nigeria , but at stake is the future of the law under which this case was brought , the Alien Tort Statute .
It allows foreign victims of human rights abuses in foreign nations to seek civil remedies in U.S. courts , and its animating idea    that people anywhere should have recourse for violations of the    law of nations '    was the foundation of our modern understanding of human rights .
In the suit , the plaintiffs accuse Royal Dutch Shell of helping the former dictatorship in the arrests on false charges and torture of 12 members of the Ogoni tribe , who sought to peacefully disrupt Shell 's operations because of the devastating health and environmental effects of unregulated drilling .
Kiobel was executed through a sham trial process in which the plaintiffs believe Shell played a central role .
The Supreme Court court accepted Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum last fall after a federal appeals court ruled that the statute could not be used to sue corporations .
The case has been brought in the United States because of our nation 's historical role in promoting the idea of universal rights and in the development of international human rights law .
From Franklin D. Roosevelt 's Four Freedoms speech and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that Eleanor Roosevelt tirelessly worked for , to the stirring oratory of Robert Jackson at the Nuremberg Tribunal , mid century Americans gave voice and visibility to the idea that all people , everywhere , were entitled to certain fundamental rights .
If , on the other hand , the Supreme Court upholds the Alien Tort Statute , it will signal to the world that we do still believe that people everywhere are entitled to certain fundamental rights and that we will help enforce those rights .
