For the second time during his papacy , Pope Francis has announced a new group of bishops and archbishops set to become cardinals    and they come from all over the world .
Pope Francis said Sunday that he would hold a meeting of cardinals on February 14    during which I will name 15 new Cardinals who , coming from 13 countries from every continent , manifest the indissoluble links between the Church of Rome and the particular Churches present in the world , ' according to Vatican Radio .
New cardinals are always important because they set the tone in the church and also elect the next pope , CNN Senior Vatican Analyst John L. Allen said .
Christopher Bellitto , a professor of church history at Kean University in New Jersey , noted that Francis announced his new slate of cardinals on the Catholic Feast of the Epiphany , which commemorates the visit of the Magi to Jesus  birthplace in Bethlehem .
In other words , Francis wants a more decentralized church and wants to hear reform ideas from small communities that sit far from Catholicism 's power centers , Bellitto said .
That does n't mean Francis is the first pontiff to appoint cardinals from the developing world , though .
Beginning in the 1920s , an increasing number of Latin American churchmen were named cardinals , and in the 1960s , St. John XXIII , whom Francis canonized last year , appointed the first cardinals from Japan , the Philippines and Africa .
Last year , Pope Francis appointed 19 new cardinals , including bishops from Haiti and Burkina Faso .
