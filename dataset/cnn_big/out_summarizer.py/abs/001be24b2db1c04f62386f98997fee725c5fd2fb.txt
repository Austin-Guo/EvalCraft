This week the Supreme Court heard two historic cases on marriage .
So pursuant to California law , the sponsors of Prop 8    officially registered with the state    stepped in to defend the law , represented by Charles Cooper at Cooper Kirk and the Alliance Defending Freedom .
So per its rules , the U.S. House voted to authorize Paul Clement    probably the greatest Supreme Court lawyer practicing today    to defend DOMA .
York did not create gay marriage until 2011 , so Windsor was not harmed by DOMA not allowing the federal government to recognize her marriage , since if the IRS used state definitions Windsor would still be regarded an a single woman .
It also raises the issue of whether courts must recognize polygamous marriages , which are legal in dozens of nations worldwide .
He openly expressed skepticism in Hollingsworth and led the Court in an hour long debate in Windsor solely focused on whether the court has jurisdiction .
On the merits , the court seems unlikely to declare an unwritten constitutional right to gay marriage , though arguments did not go as well for DOMA . Justice Anthony Kennedy is likely the swing vote in both .
As Justice Samuel Alito said this week , the Internet and cell phones have been around on this planet longer than gay marriage .
