Mr. Kasem is alert and appears comfortable at this time , ' Scott Thompson , a spokesman for the facility in Gig Harbor added .
The 82 year old former host of    American Top 40 ' and    Casey 's Top 40 ' is receiving antibiotics through IVs , blood pressure support medicine and care for his bed sores , Thompson said .
On Thursday , a message appeared on the Twitter account of Deraney PR , saying that Kasem was in    stable condition . ' A patient can be listed as both critical and stable , if his condition is poor but not deteriorating further .
Kerri Kasem ; her sister , Julie ; and their brother , Mike Kasem , have contended since last year that Jean Kasem has prevented the three siblings from visiting their father .
Kasem has Lewy body disease , the most common type of progressive dementia after Alzheimer 's , and has been bed ridden for some time .
He had been at a facility in Santa Monica , California , before Jean Kasem took him to Washington state after his daughter Kerri Kasem won temporary conservatorship over her father 's care .
Last week , a Washington court granted Kerri Kasem the right to visit her father one hour a day and to have him examined by a doctor .
Deraney expected the judge to rule on whether Jean Kasem would have to let Kerri Kasem have more input on where her father lives and who cares for him .
