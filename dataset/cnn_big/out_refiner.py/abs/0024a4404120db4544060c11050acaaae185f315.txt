By now , we 're on the same page that Mitt Romney 's pick of Paul Ryan as his running mate contradicts a golden oldie of presidential election strategy    run to the conservative  LRB  or liberal  RRB  base to win the nomination and then reposition toward the center to lure the more moderate independent swing voters who are necessary to win the general election .
A mainstay of Gallup 's measure for determining who is likely to vote    whether survey respondents are thinking a lot about the election    shows not only that Republicans are more attentive than Democrats by 13 points but also more fired up than in recent presidential elections .
To make sure they harvest the Ryan enthusiasts , the Romney campaign appears to be assembling an impressive operation to turn out the vote and to aggressively compete with the Obama team for the early vote .
What makes the Romney mobilization particularly threatening to Obama is that it targets his biggest challenge    polls consistently show him ahead but there are ominous signs that a decisive group of those supporters wo n't actually cast a ballot .
Blue collar voters    never drawn to Obama  LRB  think Hillary Clinton in 2008 Democratic primaries  RRB     may desert him in numbers that approach the    Reagan Democrat ' defections in 1980 .
By picking the bona fide conservative Ryan , the Republican base is likely to deliver a rapturous response , which may allow Romney to succeed in exploiting Obama 's greatest weakness at this point .
Refuting the conventional wisdom that Democrats do best in high turnout elections , it was Bush who most benefited from the 16 % jump in the total vote .
All in all , Romney has a tough battle ahead    even stringent counts of Electoral College votes based on polls show Obama within striking distance of winning .
