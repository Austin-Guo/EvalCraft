A U.S. Air Force spy plane evaded an encounter with the Russian military on July 18 , just a day after Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was downed by a suspected surface to air missile that Ukraine and the West allege was fired by pro Russia rebels in eastern Ukraine .
The RC 135 Rivet Joint fled into nearby Swedish airspace without that country 's permission , a U.S. military official told CNN .
The U.S. plane had been flying in international airspace , conducting an electronic eavesdropping mission on the Russian military , when the Russians took the unusual action of beginning to track it with land based radar .
The Russians then sent at least one fighter jet into the sky to intercept the aircraft , the U.S. official said Saturday .
The spy plane crew felt so concerned about the radar tracking that it wanted to get out of the area as quickly as possible , the official said .
As a result of this incident , the United States is discussing the matter with Sweden and letting officials know there may be further occurrences where American jets have to divert so quickly they may not be able to wait for permission .
We acknowledge a U.S. aircraft veered into Swedish airspace and will take active steps to ensure we have properly communicated with Swedish authorities in advance to prevent similar issues before they arise , ' the U.S. State Department said .
On April 23 , a Russian Su 27 Flanker fighter jet buzzed within 100 feet of the nose of a U.S. Air Force RC 135U reconnaissance plane over the Sea of Okhotsk between Russia and Japan , a Defense Department official said .
