The attorney for a suburban New York cardiologist charged in what authorities say was a failed scheme to have another physician hurt or killed is calling the allegations against his client    completely unsubstantiated . ' 
Appearing Saturday morning on CNN 's    New Day , ' Randy Zelin defended his client , Dr. Anthony Moschetto , who faces criminal solicitation , conspiracy , burglary , arson , criminal prescription sale and weapons charges in connection to what prosecutors called a plot to take out a rival doctor on Long Island .
None of anything in this case has any evidentiary value , ' Zelin told CNN 's Christi Paul .
And amazingly , his patients were flooding the office with calls , making sure that he was OK , ' Zelin said .
The investigation began back in December , when undercover officers began buying heroin and oxycodone pills from Moschetto in what was initially a routine investigation into the sale of prescription drugs , officials said .
During the course of the undercover operation , however , Moschetto also sold the officers two semiautomatic assault weapons as well as ammunition , prosecutors said .
The fire damaged but did not destroy the office of another cardiologist whose relationship with Dr. Moschetto had soured due to a professional dispute , ' according to the statement from the district attorney 's office .
Moschetto allegedly gave an informant and undercover detective blank prescriptions and cash for the assault and killing of the fellow cardiologist , according to prosecutors .
He was willing to pay $ 5,000 to have him beaten and put in a hospital for a few months , and then he said he would pay $ 20,000 to have him killed , ' said Assistant District Attorney Anne Donnelly , according to CNN affiliate WCBS .
