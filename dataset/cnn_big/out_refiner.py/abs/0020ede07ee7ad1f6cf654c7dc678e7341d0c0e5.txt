As a 20 year old , Ana Ivanovic claimed the French Open on Roland Garros  clay courts .
I 've been working really hard , ' Ivanovic told retired grand slam champion Kim Clijsters in an interview for CNN 's Open Court show .
I have a new team with me since Wimbledon and it 's a Serbian team for me for the first time . ' 
Ivanovic 's new team includes coach and hitting partner Nemanja Kontic    who represented Montenegro in the Davis Cup    fitness coach Zlatko Novkovic and physio Branko Penic .
In Kontic , Ivanovic may not have a wise professor on her hands as she did with Sears , yet the 32 year old , ranked 1,635 th in men 's doubles , is able to offer her something that respect within the game can not always buy    a shared cultural identity .
Employing a coaching team made up of her compatriots could be key to Ivanovic performing consistently , according to a former grand slam champion turned coach .
Ivanovic has had a number of high profile boyfriends    including Masters winning golfer Adam Scott and fellow tennis player Fernando Verdasco    but as Caroline Wozniacki has discovered , it is tough combining consistency on court with such a relationship .
But can she beat Petra Kvitova and Serena in a row ? ' 
Clijsters retired for a second time in 2012 , having won four grand slams , as she decided to focus on her family    and has since had a second child .
Ivanovic , now 26 , admitted that she too has started thinking about life after tennis .
