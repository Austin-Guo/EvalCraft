LRB  CNN  RRB     Sergio Garcia , a 36 year old undocumented immigrant in California , has held two lifelong dreams : to become a U.S. citizen and to practice law .
He 's been waiting 19 years for a visa still stuck in a backlog , but the California Supreme Court ensured this week that his second dream will become a reality .
Garcia can be admitted to California 's state bar and legally practice as a lawyer there , the court ruled .
Garcia was born in Mexico in 1977 and taken to California by his parents when he was 17 months old , according to court documents .
Eight years later , at age 17 , Garcia again returned to California with his parents and without documentation , though his father had obtained permanent resident status in the United States .
That year , Garcia 's father filed an immigration visa petition on his son 's behalf , which federal immigration officials accepted in 1995 .
The visa still has not been granted , even though Garcia has lived in the state since 1994 . 
California 's Supreme Court ruled Thursday  LRB  PDF  RRB  that no state law or public policy should stop Garcia or others like him from obtaining a law license in the state .
Asked why he did n't choose a different career or pursue other opportunities , Garcia said law was his singular focus .
