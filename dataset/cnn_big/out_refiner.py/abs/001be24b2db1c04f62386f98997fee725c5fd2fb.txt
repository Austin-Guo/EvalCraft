Hollingsworth v. Perry is about whether state laws defining marriage as one man and one woman violate the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution .
So per its rules , the U.S. House voted to authorize Paul Clement    probably the greatest Supreme Court lawyer practicing today    to defend DOMA .
York did not create gay marriage until 2011 , so Windsor was not harmed by DOMA not allowing the federal government to recognize her marriage , since if the IRS used state definitions Windsor would still be regarded an a single woman .
It also raises the issue of whether courts must recognize polygamous marriages , which are legal in dozens of nations worldwide .
He openly expressed skepticism in Hollingsworth and led the Court in an hour long debate in Windsor solely focused on whether the court has jurisdiction .
If the Supreme Court declares a constitutional right to marriage other than one man , one woman , then all traditional marriage laws in all 50 states will be invalid , and there will be a serious debate  LRB  already in a lower federal court  RRB  of whether polygamists also have a constitutional right to national recognition .
On the merits , the court seems unlikely to declare an unwritten constitutional right to gay marriage , though arguments did not go as well for DOMA . Justice Anthony Kennedy is likely the swing vote in both .
As Justice Samuel Alito said this week , the Internet and cell phones have been around on this planet longer than gay marriage .
