A federal judge on Tuesday ordered a full mental competency screening for Omar Gonzalez , who is accused of jumping the White House fence , after a disputed initial examination found him not competent for trial .
Collyer expressed concern that the initial mental exam , ordered by a magistrate judge , was done before she had a chance to hear a legal motion by the defense disputing whether the magistrate had the authority to order it .
David Bos , the federal public defender representing Gonzalez , objected to any examination in the first place because he says Gonzalez is fit for trial .
But the result , finding Gonzalez not competent , ca n't be ignored , Collyer said in court Tuesday .
The judge delayed arraignment for Gonzalez on new charges the government filed against him last week .
Gonzalez was arrested in September after he allegedly jumped the White House fence and sprinted into the executive mansion , setting off concerns about Secret Service security procedures .
He was found with a folding knife and told a Secret Service agent    that he was concerned that the atmosphere was collapsing and needed to get the information to the President of the United States so that he could get the word out to the people , ' according to an agent 's affidavit filed in court .
The judge also raised concerns that the government 's handling of previous unrelated cases could mean it will take some time for Gonzalez to be examined at a federal Bureau of Prisons facility .
