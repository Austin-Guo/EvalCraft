Criminals who file fraudulent tax returns by stealing people 's identities could rake in an estimated $ 26 billion over the next five years because the IRS can not keep up with the amount of the fraud , Treasury Inspector General J. Russell George said Tuesday .
Last year , according to the Treasury Inspector General 's Office , the IRS reported that of the 2.2 million tax returns it found to be fraudulent , about 940,000 returns totaling $ 6.5 billion were related to identity theft .
The individuals whose identities were stolen may not even be aware that their identities were used to file a fraudulent tax return . ' 
Making the problem worse , George said , the IRS is hampered by limited resources .
The scope of the problem is illustrated by what George said his auditors found for tax year 2010 , in which 48,357 Social Security numbers were used multiple times as a primary taxpayer identification number .
Direct deposits should not be made to debit cards issued by financial institutions and debit card administration companies that do not take sufficient steps to authenticate individuals  identities , ' George said .
The IRS maintains it has certain filters in place at the start of the tax filing season to prevent and detect identity theft and fraud , and it says it has recently trained additional employees across the country to deal with the problem .
In testimony prepared for Tuesday 's hearing , Deputy IRS Commissioner Steven Miller said the agency can not stop all identity theft .
The agency also started a pilot program in April to help local law enforcement in obtaining tax return information related to ongoing criminal investigations .
