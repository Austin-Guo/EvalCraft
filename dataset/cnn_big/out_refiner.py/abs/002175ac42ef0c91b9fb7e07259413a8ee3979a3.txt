And as the government struggles to wade through the country 's protracted political problems , Egypt 's festering education system is orphaned    even though , with a growing youth population , it 's key to the country 's future .
Meanwhile , a report by London think tank Chatham House says just $ 129 a year is spent on each Egyptian student ; the United States , for example , spends 40 times as much .
To make up for the gaps in education , millions of middle class Egyptian families spend a large part of their income    sometimes as much as 25 %    on private tutoring .
The status quo is even more somber for Egypt 's women .
According to a recent World Bank report , the illiteracy rate for young people in Upper Egypt is 17 % , higher than the national average of 11 % , and the illiteracy rates for females is 24 % , almost twice that of males .
For the 65 % of Egyptians who do n't have Internet access    those who stand to gain the most from the service    Nafham says it hopes to form group viewings in some villages .
Another innovative initiative is Teach for Egypt , a start up created by Nada Ramadan , a 24 year old Egyptian who 's a graduate student at Georgetown University in Washington .
Based on the Teach for America model , Ramadan plans to recruit ambitious college graduates    most from within the Egyptian community and diaspora    to commit to a two year service in which they are trained extensively and placed in underprivileged schools .
