A ferocious leopard may have killed 15 people in Nepal in a 15 month span , its latest victim a 4 year old boy that the creature dragged away into the jungle to eat .
The head of boy was found in the forest a kilometer from his home Saturday morning , said Kamal Prasad Kharel , the police chief of the Baitadi district , an area about 600 kilometers  LRB  373 miles  RRB  west of Kathmandu .
Kharel said he feared the actual number of people killed by the leopard could be higher than 15 , because others have lost their life to leopard attacks in Uttarkhand state in northern India , which borders Baitadi district .
After killing its victim , the leopard takes the body away into the forest to eat .
The district administration has announced a Rs . 25,000  LRB  about $ 300  RRB  reward to anyone who captures or kills the leopard .
The local administration has sought to raise public awareness of the dangers of going alone into nearby forests and has mobilized the police , armed police force and local people who have licensed guns to hunt for the animal .
Leopards are common in the low mountain areas , as compared to the high Himalayas , across the country .
While cases of leopards killing domestic animals are common , and there are sometimes instances of leopards killing people in Nepal , this case is    extreme , ' Dhakal said .
