Four groups that advocate for immigrant rights said Thursday they will challenge Arizona 's new immigration law , which allows police to ask anyone for proof of legal U.S. residency .
This law will only make the rampant racial profiling of Latinos that is already going on in Arizona much worse , ' said Alessandra Soler Meetze , executive director of the ACLU of Arizona .
The law requires immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and requires police to question people if there is reason to suspect they 're in the United States illegally .
But a national Republican leader said Thursday that Arizona is just filling a void left by the federal government .
CNN has learned that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and other top Democratic senators will unveil the outlines of that legislation late Thursday .
But Boehner said at a briefing Thursday that    there 's not a chance ' that Congress will approve the measure this year , especially after the recent passage of a health care reform bill .
I 've been out here for a little while and know that in the middle of an election year , after we 've had bills like health care shoved down our throats and the process twisted , tortured , pressured , bribed , you can not do a serious piece of legislation of this size , with this difficulty , in this environment , ' he said .
A Pew Research Center survey late last year found that Americans believe Latinos are discriminated against more than any other major racial or ethnic group in American society .
