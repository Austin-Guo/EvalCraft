An essential nutrient found in fish oil does not appear to slow the mental decline associated with Alzheimer 's disease , according to a new study in the Journal of the American Medical Association .
The study is merely the latest to cast doubt on the mental benefits of the omega 3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid  LRB  DHA  RRB  , which until recently was considered a promising way to minimize the risk and damage of dementia .

DHA or fish oil supplements are n't likely to cause any harm to Alzheimer 's patients , but they are n't likely to do any good either , says Steven H. Ferris , Ph.D. , the director of the Aging and Dementia Research Center at New York University .
Fish oil    seems to be healthy in general , and maybe for other things it 's helpful , but it does n't benefit cognitive function in a person with Alzheimer 's , ' says Ferris , who was not involved in the study .
Several studies that followed large groups of people as they aged have suggested that a diet rich in fish is linked to a reduced risk of dementia and mental decline , but most randomized controlled trials comparing DHA supplements with placebo have found no benefit .
It 's not the first time something in large epidemiological datasets just did n't work out clinically , ' Ferris says , noting that statin medications , anti inflammatory drugs , and estrogen therapy have all failed to live up to their initial promise in preventing or treating Alzheimer 's .
A growing body of research suggests that dementia begins decades before any noticeable symptoms surface , and it 's possible that DHA helps prevent or slow those harmful changes .
Effective treatment strategies to prevent progression of  LSB  Alzheimer 's disease  RSB  will likely need to be initiated earlier , ' Yaffe writes in an editorial accompanying the study .
