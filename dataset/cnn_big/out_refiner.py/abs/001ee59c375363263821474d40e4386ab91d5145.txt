If that car parked in Harvard Yard is a rockin  , school officials may soon come a knockin  , because hanky panky between students and faculty at the elite university has officially been banned .
Specifically , the school adopted a new policy this week that prohibits romantic relationships between undergraduates and professors .
The previous policy only did so between professors and the students they taught .
The action comes nearly a year after the U.S. Department of Education announced it was investigating 55 colleges and universities , including Harvard , for violations pertaining to Title IX , the federal law prohibiting sex discrimination on college campuses .
The new policy is the result of    a formal process to review Harvard University 's Title IX policy , ' the school said .
