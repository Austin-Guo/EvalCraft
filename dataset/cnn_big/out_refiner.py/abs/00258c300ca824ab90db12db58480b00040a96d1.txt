Thousands of people filled Hong Kong 's Victoria Park on Saturday to mark the 22nd anniversary of the bloody crackdown on pro democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square .
About 26 people were arrested between February and March , according to a Hong Kong based human rights group , when an anonymous group began an internet campaign calling for anti government protests in China similar to ones that have taken hold in the Middle East .
In response to the campaign , authorities deployed heavy security along major thoroughfares , especially in Wangfujing , a busy shopping street in downtown Beijing that had been designated by the online group for protests .
The government also tightened rules on foreign reporters , explicitly warning them that they risk detention , suspension of press cards and expulsion if they show up at planned demonstrations . 
20 years on : Tiananmen remembered 
Saturday 's protest is an annual event organized by the Hong Kong Alliance , a pro democracy group .
He was fired as Communist Party chief in 1987 by Deng Xiaoping for pushing policies deemed too soft toward    bourgeois liberal ideas ' and tolerating student protests .
The April 15 memorial quickly turned into a pro democracy movement , and students held talks with the government and later a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square to press their cause .
On June 4 , 1989 , Chinese troops in armored personnel carriers and tanks rumbled toward Tiananmen Square .
Relatives of victims renew their hopes every year that Beijing 's leaders will reverse the verdict that the protests were a counter revolutionary rebellion that had to be put down .
