The General Services Administration , already under investigation for lavish spending , allowed an employee to telecommute from Hawaii even though he is based at the GSA 's Kansas City , Missouri , office , a CNN investigation has found .
And a GSA employee in Kansas City , who requested anonymity , said that hiring someone in Hawaii to work for the Kansas City region was ludicrous .
It would have reduced the cost of travel by at least 70 percent when you look at just the airfare of what it takes to from Honolulu to Washington , D.C. , where a lot of business is done . ' 
Dan Tangherlini , who was appointed acting GSA administrator this year , said the agency was examining the cost of the entire teleworking program .
The GSA    virtual employee ' program is different from telework programs offered by many private companies including CNN 's parent company , Turner Broadcasting , in which some employees are encouraged to work from home some days of the week , partially to reduce traffic congestion .
The American people have a right to know that federal bureaucrats who enjoy the benefits of virtual work are eligible and responsible stewards of the taxpayer dollars that support the program , ' according to a letter from committee Chairman Rep.
Congress launched an investigation into the GSA after a scathing inspector general 's report issued this year showed lavish spending    $ 823,000    at the agency 's Western Regions Conference in Las Vegas in October 2010 .
In addition to the Las Vegas conference , the GSA apparently spent $ 330,000 to relocate an employee from Denver to Hawaii and probably millions more on other employees over a two year period , according to a transcript of an interview with a GSA event planner .
In July , a CNN investigation revealed that the GSA 's Kansas City office spent more than $ 20,000 to send employees to cooking classes to build team spirit .
