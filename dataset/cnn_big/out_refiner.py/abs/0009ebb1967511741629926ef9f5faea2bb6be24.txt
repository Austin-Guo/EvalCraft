If you travel by plane and arriving on time makes a difference , try to book on Hawaiian Airlines .
In 2012 , passengers got where they needed to go without delay on the carrier more than nine times out of 10 , according to a study released on Monday .
The Airline Quality Rankings Report looks at the 14 largest U.S. airlines and is based on an analysis of U.S. Department of Transportation figures .
In addition to on time performance , the joint project looks at three other categories : rate of consumer complaints , mishandled bags and denied boarding performance .
At a time when U.S. airlines are a whipping post for passenger complaints about crowded flights , tight seats , costly tickets and unsatisfactory service , there is a glimmer of hope .
Eight airlines improved their on time arrival performance in 2012 .
ExpressJet and American Airlines had the worst on time performance  LRB  76.9 %  RRB  last year , according to the data gathered in the 23rd annual report .
RRB  American Eagle showed improvement from 2011 but still came in last , fumbling baggage at a rate of 5.80 mishandled bags per 1,000 passengers .
