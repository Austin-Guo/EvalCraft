Stancheva said the refugee applications by Burkhart and his mother were denied by the Canadian government , and she has not seen Burkhart since early March of 2010 .
Prosecutors said his    rage against Americans , ' triggered by his mother 's arrest last week , motivated his    campaign of terror ' with dozens of fires in Hollywood and nearby communities .
This defendant has engaged in a protracted campaign in which he has set , the people believe , upwards of 52 arson fires in what essentially amounts to a campaign of terror against this community , ' Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Sean Carney said .
The people believe he has engaged in this conduct because he has a hatred for Americans . ' 
Carney told the court Burkhart would flee the country if he was allowed out of jail on bond , but Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Upinder Kalra said he had no choice but to set bail .
The worst arson sprees in the city 's history began last Friday morning with a car fire in Hollywood that spread to apartments above a garage , but no new fires have happened since Burkhart was arrested Monday , Los Angeles District Attorney Steve Cooley said .
Cooley called it    almost attempted murder , ' because people were sleeping in apartments above where Burkhart allegedly set cars on fire with incendiary devices placed under their engines .
The vast majority of these fires occurred late at night when the occupants of the apartment buildings were asleep . ' 
Investigator Edward Nordskog 's affidavit detailed Burkhart 's behavior a day before the fires began , when he was in a federal courtroom during extradition proceedings for his mother .
The charges include an allegation that she failed to pay for a breast enhancement operation performed on her in 2004 , Meilinger said .
