David Bos , the federal public defender representing Gonzalez , objected to any examination in the first place because he says Gonzalez is fit for trial .
But the result , finding Gonzalez not competent , ca n't be ignored , Collyer said in court Tuesday .
Bos told the judge :    There is no doubt in my mind that Mr. Gonzalez is competent to stand trial . '
Nonetheless , he withdrew his objections and agreed to allow his client to undergo a fuller competency examination to try to undo the results of the initial examination .
Gonzalez was arrested in September after he allegedly jumped the White House fence and sprinted into the executive mansion , setting off concerns about Secret Service security procedures .
He was found with a folding knife and told a Secret Service agent    that he was concerned that the atmosphere was collapsing and needed to get the information to the President of the United States so that he could get the word out to the people , ' according to an agent 's affidavit filed in court .
Collyer said that during the initial examination , the mental health screener found Gonzalez did understand some parts of the proceedings .
Collyer ordered the mental health screening to be done in 30 days and set a new hearing for December 3 at 10:30 a.m.
