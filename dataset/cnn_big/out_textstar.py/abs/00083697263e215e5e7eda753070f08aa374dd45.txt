Police investigating the case learned where 36 year old Vittorio Arrigoni was being held and went to the location , where they found the body , the statement said .
An autopsy revealed that he had been killed hours before police entered the location , it said .
A black blindfold covered his eyes ; his right cheek appeared red as though it had been hit ; his hands appeared to be bound behind his back .
A hand belonging to someone outside of the view of the lens appeared to be grasping his hair on the back and pointing the captive 's head toward the camera .
Al Saeedni is the leader of a group that may have been inspired by al Qaeda , said Alfredo Tradardi , the Italy coordinator for the International Solidarity Movement , where Arrigoni was a volunteer .
Arrigoni 's colleagues last saw him about 8 p.m. Wednesday near the port in Gaza City , said Joe Catron , a member of the International Solidarity Movement .
I think he was just the first foreigner they ran across , ' Catron said about the abductors .
It is ironic they happened to come across someone who has dedicated a part of his life to helping Palestine . '
