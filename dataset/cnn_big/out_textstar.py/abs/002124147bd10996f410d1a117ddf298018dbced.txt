ISIS did n't just remind us how cruel humans can be ; it has taken the use of brutality as a weapon of intimidation , extermination , genocide and recruitment propaganda to new levels .
ISIS is not the first to murder victims in large numbers ; it is not the first to kill those who disagree with its beliefs or who belong to different ethnic or religious groups .
More important , those using these methods , embracing this philosophy , are in control of enormous territories .
When ISIS calls itself a state , it is not hyperbole by very much .
If not stopped , it could continue its push toward the oil fields of southern Iraq at the edge of the Persian Gulf , which remains the epicenter of oil and gas production that allows the global economy to function .
If Osama bin Laden were n't dead , he would die of envy .
ISIS can simply not be allowed to keep a foothold in the Middle East .
If it does , the consequences will become even more catastrophic .
