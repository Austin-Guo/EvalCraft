The candlelight vigil comes after recent efforts by the Chinese government to quash would be demonstrators from holding anti government protests .
About 26 people were arrested between February and March , according to a Hong Kong based human rights group , when an anonymous group began an internet campaign calling for anti government protests in China similar to ones that have taken hold in the Middle East .
The government also tightened rules on foreign reporters , explicitly warning them that they risk detention , suspension of press cards and expulsion if they show up at planned demonstrations .
20 years on : Tiananmen remembered 
Saturday 's protest is an annual event organized by the Hong Kong Alliance , a pro democracy group .
Images of the demonstration showed a sea of flickering candles covering the length of the park .
The April 15 memorial quickly turned into a pro democracy movement , and students held talks with the government and later a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square to press their cause .
Along the way , they met fierce resistance from students and city residents who barricaded the streets , so they fired at them .
When the firing stopped , hundreds if not thousands of people lay maimed or dead .
