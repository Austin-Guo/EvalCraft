The American people have a right to know that federal bureaucrats who enjoy the benefits of virtual work are eligible and responsible stewards of the taxpayer dollars that support the program , ' according to a letter from committee Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa , R California , to the GSA .
The details requested by Issa about the GSA program have not been provided to the committee .
CNN also requested the information more than two months ago through the federal Freedom of Information Act but has been repeatedly told by the GSA that FOIA staff members have not finished compiling the material .
The General Services Administration , which has more than 12,600 employees and a $ 26.3 billion budget , is a relatively obscure federal agency that handles government real estate and other non military procurement .
