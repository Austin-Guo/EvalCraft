Uyghurs are a Muslim minority from the Xinjiang province of far west China .
The 17 Uyghurs had left China and made their way to Afghanistan , where they settled in a camp with other Uyghurs opposed to the Chinese government , the Justice Department said in its statement .
Issues to be worked out include how to transfer the Uyghurs to Palau and how much money the United States would give the men for resettlement , the official said .
The official said the average in such cases is $ 100,000 per person .
The United States will not send Uyghur detainees cleared for release back to China out of concern that they would be tortured by Chinese authorities .
China has said no returned Uyghurs would be tortured .
