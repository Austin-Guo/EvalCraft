Stancheva said she and other doctors including a psychiatrist diagnosed Burkhart with    autism , severe anxiety , post traumatic stress disorder and depression . '
The diagnosis was spelled out in a letter she wrote for the small claims court case , Stancheva said .
Prosecutors said his    rage against Americans , ' triggered by his mother 's arrest last week , motivated his    campaign of terror ' with dozens of fires in Hollywood and nearby communities .
Burkhart kept his eyes closed and remained limp during most of his hearing , requiring sheriff 's deputies to hold him up .
The district attorney called his courtroom behavior    very bizarre . '
This defendant has engaged in a protracted campaign in which he has set , the people believe , upwards of 52 arson fires in what essentially amounts to a campaign of terror against this community , ' Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Sean Carney said .
The people believe he has engaged in this conduct because he has a hatred for Americans . '
