Britain 's ambassador to the United States , Peter Westmacott , told CNN on Sunday that British officials were close to identifying the ISIS militant who beheaded Foley , an American journalist captured in Syria in 2012 .
He could n't elaborate on the identity of the killer , who is seen decapitating Foley in a video posted last week on YouTube .
We 're putting a great deal into the search , ' he said , referring to the use of sophisticated technology to analyze the man 's voice .
In the video , Foley , 40 , is seen kneeling next to a man dressed in black , who speaks with what experts say is a distinctly English accent .
Linguists said that based on his voice , the man sounds to be younger than 30 .
Moallem , however , warned against any unilateral action or strikes in Syrian territory without its permission , saying    any effort to fight terrorism should be done in coordination ' with the    Syrian government . '
