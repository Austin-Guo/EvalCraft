The Bush administration took office at the end of an economic boom and left in the middle of a deep recession , with a budget surplus in 2001 becoming a $ 1 trillion plus deficit by 2009 .
But Cheney said he and Bush had to spend money to deal with the September 11 , 2001 attacks , the resulting war in Afghanistan , the disaster of 2005 's Hurricane Katrina , and the costly and unpopular war in Iraq , now nearly six years old .
All of these things required us to spend money that we had not originally planned to spend , or were n't originally part of the budget , ' Cheney said .
But Sestak said the administration was too slow to react to the problems it faced in Iraq and let the conflict overshadow the    whole fabric ' of U.S. national security .
And Cheney said he argued against the administration 's policy on North Korea , which tested a nuclear weapon in 2006 .
The Bush administration reached a still incomplete disarmament deal with the isolated Stalinist state in 2007 and removed it from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism as part of the deal .
I had my say , ' Cheney told CNN .
I got my chance to voice my views and my objections .
