 LRB  CNN  RRB     By now , we 're on the same page that Mitt Romney 's pick of Paul Ryan as his running mate contradicts a golden oldie of presidential election strategy    run to the conservative  LRB  or liberal  RRB  base to win the nomination and then reposition toward the center to lure the more moderate independent swing voters who are necessary to win the general election .
Ryan may be many things    energetic , charismatic and geeky    but no one familiar with his Full Monty conservative budgets would describe his selection as remotely moving to the center .
Just the opposite    Romney has doubled down on his move to the right during the primary battle .
What gives ?
All in all , Romney has a tough battle ahead    even stringent counts of Electoral College votes based on polls show Obama within striking distance of winning .
And , it may produce a campaign focused a bit more on policy than on birth certificates , service records and the other side issues of recent elections .
Strap in , folks , 2012 may be much more interesting and close than we 'd imagined .
