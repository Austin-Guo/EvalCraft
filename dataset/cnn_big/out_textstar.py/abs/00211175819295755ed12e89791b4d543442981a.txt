Garaufis cited    the clear evidence of disparate impact that Mayor  LRB  Michael  RRB  Bloomberg and his senior leadership chose to ignore was obvious to anyone else who looked . '
Instead of facing hard facts and asking hard questions about the City 's abysmal track record of hiring black and Hispanic firefighters , the Bloomberg Administration dug in and fought back , ' the judge said in his ruling .
Bloomberg said 61,000 people , more than half of them minorities , applied to the fire department in the last recruiting campaign ,    shattering any previous record for minority applicants . '
Garaufis acknowledged that the city has improved its minority recruiting , but he said the subsequent hiring processes and    discriminatory testing procedures ' have kept many of these minorities from actually being hired .
Paul Washington , a representative of the Vulcan Society , one of the plaintiffs in the case , praised the decision .
We 're very pleased to see this order and it 's certainly long overdue , ' Washington said .
We 're glad to see the judge properly addressing this issue . '
