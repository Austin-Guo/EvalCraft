It might well send Hollywood literary agents and producers scrambling for story details as described by police reports and local media accounts .
Two alleged co conspirators have been detained : Alleged hit man Yuri Zarutsky    a burly , bearded Russian who was previously convicted of beating someone to death    and Andrey Lipatov , who allegedly drove the getaway car after Zarutksy 's battery acid attack on Filin .
Someone slashed his car tires .
Somebody also attempted to hack his Facebook page .
The trio of conspirators obtained battery acid at a car parts store , and made the acid stronger by evaporating the water from it , police said .
Calls from those phones led investigators to Lipatov , the alleged driver .
I did n't see what happened there , ' Lipatov told them in a video released by police .
I just took Yuri there , waited for him and gave him a lift back . '
