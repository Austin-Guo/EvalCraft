So even if Zimmerman killed Martin , he was justified in doing so if he believed he was in danger of being killed himself or of suffering great bodily harm .
It seems the Sanford Police certainly believed Zimmerman 's claims .
But there is an exception .
If Zimmerman was the initial aggressor , he can not avail himself of the protection of the    stand your ground ' law .
Former Florida State Rep. Dennis Baxley , the co sponsor of the law , told me by phone that the law does n't apply to Zimmerman if he pursued Martin and was the initial aggressor .
And he is right .
Florida 's statute makes it clear that the justification is not available to a person who initially provokes the use of force against himself , unless such force is so great that the person reasonably believes that he is in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm and that he has exhausted every reasonable means to escape .
And that is what this case ultimately boils down to    who started the fight .
