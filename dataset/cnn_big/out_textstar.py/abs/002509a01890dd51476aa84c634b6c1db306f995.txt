The case concerns the torture of Ogoni leaders in Nigeria , but at stake is the future of the law under which this case was brought , the Alien Tort Statute .
The United States stands at a crossroads .
The case has been brought in the United States because of our nation 's historical role in promoting the idea of universal rights and in the development of international human rights law .
The United States is abandoning its role as the global champion of human rights , ' Jimmy Carter wrote bluntly in The New York Times in June .
Successful cases were brought against government officials , against non state actors like Radovan Karadžić in Bosnia Herzegovina and against multinational corporations before the Second Circuit ruling in Kiobel that disallowed that .
If , on the other hand , the Supreme Court upholds the Alien Tort Statute , it will signal to the world that we do still believe that people everywhere are entitled to certain fundamental rights and that we will help enforce those rights .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Vincent Warren .
