The 26 year old Bolt has now collected eight gold medals at world championships , equaling the record held by American trio Carl Lewis , Michael Johnson and Allyson Felix , not to mention the small matter of six Olympic titles .
The relay triumph followed individual successes in the 100 and 200 meters in the Russian capital .
I 'm proud of myself and I 'll continue to work to dominate for as long as possible , ' Bolt said , having previously expressed his intention to carry on until the 2016 Rio Olympics .
Their quartet recorded a championship record of 41.29 seconds , well clear of France , who crossed the line in second place in 42.73 seconds .
Bolt 's final dash for golden glory brought the eight day championship to a rousing finale , but while the hosts topped the medal table from the United States there was criticism of the poor attendances in the Luzhniki Stadium .
