The head of boy was found in the forest a kilometer from his home Saturday morning , said Kamal Prasad Kharel , the police chief of the Baitadi district , an area about 600 kilometers  LRB  373 miles  RRB  west of Kathmandu .
The grisly discovery , which came after teams of people searched for the child , marks the 15th victim in the past 15 months in that remote district in western Nepal .
The police chief suspects that a single man eating leopard is responsible for the deaths .
If not , there are at most two of the man eating creatures around , he believes .
The others are older children and a 29 year old woman who had gone to collect fodder for domestic animals in the nearby forest , a common practice in Nepal .
No adult male has been killed , ' Kharel said .
The chief district administrator has granted permission for this particular leopard to be killed .
