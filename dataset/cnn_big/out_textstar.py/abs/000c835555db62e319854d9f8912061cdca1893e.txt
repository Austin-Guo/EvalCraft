New cardinals are always important because they set the tone in the church and also elect the next pope , CNN Senior Vatican Analyst John L. Allen said .
They are sometimes referred to as the princes of the Catholic Church .
The new cardinals come from countries such as Ethiopia , New Zealand and Myanmar .
This is a pope who very much wants to reach out to people on the margins , and you clearly see that in this set , ' Allen said .
Francis  pattern is very clear : He wants to go to the geographical peripheries rather than places that are already top heavy with cardinals , ' Allen said .
In other words , Francis wants a more decentralized church and wants to hear reform ideas from small communities that sit far from Catholicism 's power centers , Bellitto said .
That does n't mean Francis is the first pontiff to appoint cardinals from the developing world , though .
Beginning in the 1920s , an increasing number of Latin American churchmen were named cardinals , and in the 1960s , St. John XXIII , whom Francis canonized last year , appointed the first cardinals from Japan , the Philippines and Africa .
