acute lung injury is a syndrome of inflammation and of increased permeability of the blood  gas barrier .
endothelins are thought to exert proinflammatory effects .
kuklin and colleagues show that the endothelin receptor antagonist tezosentan reduces pulmonary edema in endotoxemic sheep , in parallel with a prevention of protein kinase c- activation . in turn
, the level of some cytokines increased after tezosentan treatment .
whether these contrasting effects of endothelin blockade on inflammatory mechanisms have clinical relevance and whether these agents might benefit patients with acute lung injury is unknown .
