we describe cisred , a database for conserved regulatory elements that are identified and ranked by a genome - scale computational system ( ) .
the database and high - throughput predictive pipeline are designed to address diverse target genomes in the context of rapidly evolving data resources and tools .
motifs are predicted in promoter regions using multiple discovery methods applied to sequence sets that include corresponding sequence regions from vertebrates .
we estimate motif significance by applying discovery and post - processing methods to randomized sequence sets that are adaptively derived from target sequence sets , retain motifs with p - values below a threshold and identify groups of similar motifs and co - occurring motif patterns .
the database offers information on atomic motifs , motif groups and patterns .
it is web - accessible , and can be queried directly , downloaded or installed locally .
