prokaryotic genomic dna is generally negatively supercoiled in vivo .
many regulatory processes , including the initiation of transcription , are known to depend on the superhelical state of the dna substrate .
the stresses induced within dna by negative superhelicity can destabilize the dna duplex at specific sites .
various experiments have either shown or suggested that stress - induced dna duplex destabilization ( sidd ) is involved in specific regulatory mechanisms governing a variety of biological processes .
we have developed methods to evaluate the sidd properties of dna sequences , including complete chromosomes .
this analysis predicts the locations where the duplex becomes destabilized under superhelical stress .
previous studies have shown that the sidd - susceptible sites predicted in this way occur at rates much higher than expected at random in transcriptional regulatory regions , and much lower than expected in coding regions .
analysis of the sidd profiles of 42 bacterial genomes chosen for their diversity confirms this pattern .
predictions of sidd sites have been used to identify potential genomic regulatory regions , and suggest both possible regulatory mechanisms involving stress - induced destabilization and experimental tests of these mechanisms .
here we describe the siddbase database which enables users to retrieve and visualize the results of sidd analyses of completely sequenced prokaryotic and archaeal genomes , together with their annotations .
siddbase is available at .
