Database Security Curriculum in InfoSec Program
ABSTRACT
Database Security course is an important part of the InfoSec 
curriculum.  In many institutions this is not taught as an 
independent course.  Parts of the contents presented in this paper 
are usually incorporated in other courses such as Network 
Security.  The importance of database security concepts stems 
from the fact that a compromise of data at rest could expose an 
organization to a greater security threat than otherwise.

Database vulnerabilities exposed recently in several high profile 
incidents would be a good reason to dedicate a full course to this 
important topic.  In this paper we present key topics such as 
technologies for database protection, access control, multilevel 
security, database vulnerabilities and defenses, privacy and legal 
issues, impact of policies and some well known secure database 
models.
