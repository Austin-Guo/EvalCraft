A Unified Approach for Improving QoS and Provider Revenue in 3G Mobile Networks
Abstract
In this paper, we introduce a unified approach for the adaptive control of 3G mobile networks in order to improve both quality
of service (QoS) for mobile subscribers and to increase revenue for service providers. The introduced approach constantly monitors QoS
measures as packet loss probability and the current number of active mobile users during operation of the network. Based on the values
of the QoS measures just observed, the system parameters of the admission controller and packet scheduler are controlled by the adaptive
performance management entity. Considering UMTS, we present performance curves showing that handover failure probability is improved
by more than one order of magnitude. Moreover, the packet loss probability can be effectively regulated to a predefined level and provider
revenue is significantly increased for all pricing policies.
