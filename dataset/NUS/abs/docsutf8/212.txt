Video-Streaming for Fast Moving Users in 3G Mobile Networks
ABSTRACT
The emergence of third-generation (
3G) mobile networks offers
new opportunities for the effective delivery of data with rich content
including multimedia messaging and video-streaming. Provided
that streaming services have proved highly successful over
stationary networks in the past, we anticipate that the same trend
will soon take place in
3G networks. Although mobile operators
currently make available pertinent services, the available resources
of the underlying networks for the delivery of rich data remain in-herently
constrained. At this stage and in light of large numbers
of users moving fast across cells,
3G networks may not be able
to warrant the needed quality-of-service requirements. The support
for streaming services necessitates the presence of content or media
servers properly placed over the
3G network; such servers essen-tially
become the source for streaming applications. Evidently, a
centralized approach in organizing streaming content might lead to
highly congested media-nodes which in presence of moving users
will certainly yield increased response times and jitter to user requests
. In this paper, we propose a workaround that enables
3G networks
to offer uninterrupted video-streaming services in the presence
of a large number of users moving in high-speed. At the same
time, we offer a distributed organization for the network's media-servers
to better handle over-utilization.
