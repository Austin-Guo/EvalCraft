Topic Transition Detection Using Hierarchical Hidden Markov and Semi-Markov Models
ABSTRACT
In this paper we introduce a probabilistic framework to exploit
hierarchy, structure sharing and duration information
for topic transition detection in videos. Our probabilistic detection
framework is a combination of a shot classification
step and a detection phase using hierarchical probabilistic
models. We consider two models in this paper: the extended
Hierarchical Hidden Markov Model (HHMM) and the Coxian
Switching Hidden semi-Markov Model (S-HSMM) because
they allow the natural decomposition of semantics in
videos, including shared structures, to be modeled directly,
and thus enabling efficient inference and reducing the sample
complexity in learning. Additionally, the S-HSMM allows
the duration information to be incorporated, consequently
the modeling of long-term dependencies in videos
is enriched through both hierarchical and duration modeling
. Furthermore, the use of the Coxian distribution in the
S-HSMM makes it tractable to deal with long sequences in
video. Our experimentation of the proposed framework on
twelve educational and training videos shows that both models
outperform the baseline cases (flat HMM and HSMM)
and performances reported in earlier work in topic detection
. The superior performance of the S-HSMM over the
HHMM verifies our belief that duration information is an
important factor in video content modeling.
