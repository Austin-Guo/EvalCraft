Seven Cardinal Properties of Sensor Network Broadcast Authentication
ABSTRACT
We investigate the design space of sensor network broadcast authentication
. We show that prior approaches can be organized based
on a taxonomy of seven fundamental proprieties, such that each approach
can satisfy at most six of the seven proprieties. An empirical
study of the design space reveals possibilities of new approaches,
which we present in the following two new authentication protocols
: RPT and LEA. Based on this taxonomy, we offer guidance in
selecting the most appropriate protocol based on an application's
desired proprieties. Finally, we pose the open challenge for the research
community to devise a protocol simultaneously providing
all seven properties.
