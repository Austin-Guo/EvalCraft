High Performance Crawling System
ABSTRACT
In the present paper, we will describe the design and implementation
of a real-time distributed system of Web crawling
running on a cluster of machines.
The system crawls
several thousands of pages every second, includes a high-performance
fault manager, is platform independent and is
able to adapt transparently to a wide range of configurations
without incurring additional hardware expenditure. We will
then provide details of the system architecture and describe
the technical choices for very high performance crawling.
Finally, we will discuss the experimental results obtained,
comparing them with other documented systems.
