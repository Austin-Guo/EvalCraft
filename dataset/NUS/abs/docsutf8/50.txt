Building Sustainable Community Information Systems: Lessons from a Digital Government Project
ABSTRACT
This paper introduces a rationale for and approach to the study of
sustainability in computerized community information systems.  It
begins by presenting a theoretical framework for posing questions
about sustainability predicated upon assumptions from social
construction of technology and adaptive structuration theories.
Based in part on the literature and in part on our own experiences
in developing a community information system, we introduce and
consider three issues related to sustainability:  stakeholder
involvement, commitment from key players, and the development
of critical mass.
