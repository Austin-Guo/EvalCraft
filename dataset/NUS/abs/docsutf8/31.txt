An empirical comparison of supervised machine learning techniques in bioinformatics
Abstract
Research in bioinformatics is driven by the experimental data. 
Current biological databases are populated by vast amounts of 
experimental data. Machine learning has been widely applied to 
bioinformatics and has gained a lot of success in this research 
area.  At present, with various learning algorithms available in the 
literature, researchers are facing difficulties in choosing the best 
method that can apply to their data. We performed an empirical 
study on 7 individual learning systems and 9 different combined 
methods on 4 different biological data sets, and provide some 
suggested issues to be considered when answering the following 
questions: (i) How does one choose which algorithm is best 
suitable for their data set? (ii) Are combined methods better than 
a single approach? (iii) How does one compare the effectiveness 
of a particular algorithm to <A href="31.html#1">the others?
