ResearchExplorer: Gaining Insights through Exploration in Multimedia Scientific Data
ABSTRACT
An increasing amount of heterogeneous information about 
scientific research is becoming available on-line. This potentially 
allows users to explore the information from multiple perspectives 
and derive insights and not just raw data about a topic of interest.  
However, most current scientific information search systems lag 
behind this trend; being text-based, they are fundamentally 
incapable of dealing with multimedia data. An even more 
important limitation is that their information environments are 
information-centric and therefore are not suitable if insights are 
desired. Towards this goal, in this paper, we describe the design 
of a system, called ResearchExplorer, which facilitates exploring 
multimedia scientific data to gain insights. This is accomplished 
by providing an interaction environment for insights where users 
can explore multimedia scientific information sources. The 
multimedia information is united around the notion of research 
event and can be accessed in a unified way. Experiments are 
conducted to show how ResearchExplorer works and how it 
cardinally differs from other search systems.
