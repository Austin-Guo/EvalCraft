A Taxonomy of Ambient Information Systems: Four Patterns of Design
ABSTRACT
Researchers  have  explored  the  design  of  ambient  information 
systems across  a wide range of physical and screen-based media. 
This work has yielded rich examples of design approaches to the 
problem of presenting information about a user's world in a way 
that is not distracting, but is aesthetically pleasing, and tangible to 
varying degrees. Despite these successes, accumulating theoretical 
and  craft  knowledge  has  been  stymied  by  the  lack  of  a  unified 
vocabulary  to  describe  these  systems  and  a  consequent  lack  of  a 
framework for understanding their design attributes. We argue that 
this  area  would  significantly  benefit  from  consensus  about  the 
design  space  of  ambient  information  systems  and  the  design 
attributes  that  define  and  distinguish  existing  approaches.  We 
present  a  definition  of  ambient  information  systems  and  a 
taxonomy  across  four  design  dimensions:  Information  Capacity, 
Notification  Level,  Representational  Fidelity,  and  Aesthetic 
Emphasis.  Our  analysis  has  uncovered  four  patterns  of  system 
design  and  points  to  unexplored  regions  of  the  design  space, 
which may motivate future work in the field.
