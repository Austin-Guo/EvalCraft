Learning Concepts from Large Scale Imbalanced Data Sets Using Support Cluster Machines
ABSTRACT
This paper considers the problem of using Support Vector
Machines (SVMs) to learn concepts from large scale imbalanced
data sets.
The objective of this paper is twofold.
Firstly, we investigate the effects of large scale and imbalance
on SVMs.
We highlight the role of linear non-separability
in this problem. Secondly, we develop a both
practical and theoretical guaranteed meta-algorithm to handle
the trouble of scale and imbalance.
The approach is
named Support Cluster Machines (SCMs). It incorporates
the informative and the representative under-sampling mechanisms
to speedup the training procedure. The SCMs differs
from the previous similar ideas in two ways, (a) the theoretical
foundation has been provided, and (b) the clustering
is performed in the feature space rather than in the input
space. The theoretical analysis not only provides justification
, but also guides the technical choices of the proposed
approach. Finally, experiments on both the synthetic and
the TRECVID data are carried out. The results support
the previous analysis and show that the SCMs are efficient
and effective while dealing with large scale imbalanced data
sets.
