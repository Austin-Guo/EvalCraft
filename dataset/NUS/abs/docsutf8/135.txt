Measuring Cohesion of Packages in Ada95
ABSTRACT
Ada95 is an object-oriented programming language. Pack-ages 
are basic program units in Ada 95 to support OO programming, 
which allow the specification of groups of logically related 
entities. Thus, the cohesion of a package is mainly about how 
tightly the entities are encapsulated in the package. This paper 
discusses the relationships among these entities based on 
dependence analysis and presents the properties to obtain these 
dependencies. Based on these, the paper proposes an approach to 
measure the package cohesion, which satisfies the properties that 
a good measure should have.
