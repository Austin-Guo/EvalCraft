Building a Research Library for the History of the Web
ABSTRACT
This paper describes the building of a research library for studying 
the Web, especially research on how the structure and content of the 
Web change over time. The library is particularly aimed at 
supporting social scientists for whom the Web is both a fascinating 
social phenomenon and a mirror on society.
The library is built on the collections of the Internet Archive, which 
has been preserving a crawl of the Web every two months since 
1996. The technical challenges in organizing this data for research 
fall into two categories: high-performance computing to transfer and 
manage the very large amounts of data, and human-computer 
interfaces that empower research by non-computer specialists.
