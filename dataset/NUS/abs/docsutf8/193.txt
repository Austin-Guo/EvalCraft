Through Different Eyes - Assessing Multiple Conceptual Views for Querying Web Services
ABSTRACT
We present enhancements for UDDI / DAML-S registries allowing
cooperative discovery and selection of Web services with a 
focus on personalization. To find the most useful service in each 
instance of a request, not only explicit parameters of the request 
have to be matched against the service offers. Also user preferences
or implicit assumptions of a user with respect to common 
knowledge in a certain domain have to be considered to improve 
the quality of service provisioning. In the area of Web services 
the notion of service ontologies together with cooperative answering
techniques can take a lot of this responsibility. However, 
without quality assessments for the relaxation of service requests 
and queries a personalized service discovery and selection is virtually
impossible. This paper focuses on assessing the semantic 
meaning of query relaxation plans over multiple conceptual views 
of the service ontology, each one representing a soft query constraint
of the user request. Our focus is on the question what constitutes
a minimum amount of necessary relaxation to answer each 
individual request in a cooperative manner. Incorporating such 
assessments as early as possible we propose to integrate ontology-based
discovery directly into UDDI directories or query facilities 
in service provisioning portals. Using the quality assessments 
presented here, this integration promises to propel today's Web 
services towards an intuitive user-centered service provisioning.
