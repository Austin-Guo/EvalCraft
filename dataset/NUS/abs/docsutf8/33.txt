An Index System for Quality Synthesis Evaluation of BtoC Business Website
ABSTRACT
It is important for successful electronic business to have a 
hi-quality business website. So we need an accurate and 
effective index system to evaluate and analyses the quality of 
the business website. In this paper, the evaluation index system 
following the `grey box' principle is proposed which considers 
both efficiency of business website and performance of 
electronic business system. Using R-Hierarchical clustering 
method to extract the typical indexes from sub-indexes is 
theoretically proved to have a rationality and effectiveness. 
Finally, the evaluation method is briefly discussed.
