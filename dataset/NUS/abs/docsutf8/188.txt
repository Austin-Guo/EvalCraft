The Forest and the Trees: Using Oracle and SQL Server Together to Teach ANSI-Standard SQL
ABSTRACT
Students in a sophomore-level database fundamentals course were 
taught SQL and database concepts using both Oracle and SQL 
Server. Previous offerings of the class had used one or the other 
database. Classroom experiences suggest that students were able 
to handle learning SQL in the dual environment, and, in fact, 
benefited from this approach by better understanding ANSI-standard
versus database-specific SQL and implementation 
differences in the two database systems.
