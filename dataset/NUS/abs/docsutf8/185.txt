Tactons: Structured Tactile Messages for Non-Visual Information Display
Abstract
Tactile displays are now becoming available in a form 
that can be easily used in a user interface. This paper describes
a new form of tactile output. Tactons, or tactile 
icons, are structured, abstract messages that can be used 
to communicate messages non-visually. A range of different
parameters can be used for Tacton construction including
: frequency, amplitude and duration of a tactile 
pulse, plus other parameters such as rhythm and location. 
Tactons have the potential to improve interaction in a 
range of different areas, particularly where the visual display
is overloaded, limited in size or not available, such as 
interfaces for blind people or in mobile and wearable devices
