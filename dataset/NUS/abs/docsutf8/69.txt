Digital Asset Management Using A Native XML Database Implementation
ABSTRACT
Digital Asset Management (DAM), the management of digital 
content so that it can be cataloged, searched and re-purposed, is 
extremely challenging for organizations that rely on image 
handling and expect to gain business value from these assets. 
Metadata plays a crucial role in their management, and XML, 
with its inherent support for structural representation, is an ideal 
technology for this. This paper analyzes the capabilities of a 
native XML database solution via the development of a "proof of 
concept" and describes implementation requirements, strategy, 
and advantages and disadvantages of this solution.
