Analysis of Soft Handover Measurements in 3G Network
ABSTRACT
A neural network based clustering method for the analysis
of soft handovers in 3G network is introduced. The method
is highly visual and it could be utilized in explorative analysis
of mobile networks. In this paper, the method is used
to find groups of similar mobile cell pairs in the sense of
handover measurements. The groups or clusters found by
the method are characterized by the rate of successful handovers
as well as the causes of failing handover attempts.
The most interesting clusters are those which represent certain
type of problems in handover attempts. By comparing
variable histograms of a selected cluster to histograms of
the whole data set an application domain expert may find
some explanations on problems. Two clusters are investigated
further and causes of failing handover attempts are
discussed.
