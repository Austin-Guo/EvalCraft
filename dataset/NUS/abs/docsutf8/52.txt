Catenaccio: Interactive Information Retrieval System through Drawing
ABSTRACT
The Catenaccio system integrates information retrieval with 
sketch manipulations. The system is designed especially for pen-based
computing and allows users to retrieve information by 
simple pen manipulations such as drawing a picture. When a user 
draws a circle and writes a keyword, information nodes related to 
the keyword are collected automatically inside the circle. In 
addition, the user can create a Venn diagram by repeatedly 
drawing circles and keywords to form more complex queries. 
Thus, the user can retrieve information both interactively and 
visually without complex manipulations. Moreover, the sketch 
interaction is so simple that it is possible to combine it with other 
types of data such as images and real-world information for 
information retrieval. In this paper, we describe our Catenaccio 
system and how it can be effectively applied.
