A Programming Languages Course for Freshmen
ABSTRACT
Programming languages are a part of the core of computer 
science. Courses on programming languages are typically offered 
to junior or senior students, and textbooks are based on this 
assumption. However, our computer science curriculum offers the 
programming languages course in the first year. This unusual 
situation led us to design it from an untypical approach. In this 
paper, we first analyze and classify proposals for the 
programming languages course into different pure and hybrid 
approaches. Then, we describe a course for freshmen based on 
four pure approaches, and justify the main choices made. Finally, 
we identify the software used for laboratories and outline our 
experience after teaching it for seven years.
