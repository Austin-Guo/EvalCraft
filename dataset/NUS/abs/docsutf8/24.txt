A WEIGHTED RANKING ALGORITHM FOR FACET-BASED COMPONENT RETRIEVAL SYSTEM
ABSTRACT
Facet-based component retrieval techniques have been 
proved to be an effective way for retrieving. These 
Techniques are widely adopted by component library 
systems, but they usually simply list out all the retrieval 
results without any kind of ranking. In our work, we focus 
on the problem that how to determine the ranks of the 
components retrieved by user. Factors which can 
influence the ranking are extracted and identified through 
the analysis of ER-Diagram of facet-based component 
library system. In this paper, a mathematical model of 
weighted ranking algorithm is proposed and the timing of 
ranks calculation is discussed. Experiment results show 
that this algorithm greatly improves the efficiency of 
component retrieval system.
