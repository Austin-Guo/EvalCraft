A Resilient Packet-Forwarding Scheme against Maliciously Packet-Dropping Nodes in Sensor Networks
ABSTRACT
This paper focuses on defending against compromised nodes'
dropping of legitimate reports and investigates the misbehavior
of a maliciously packet-dropping node in sensor networks
. We present a resilient packet-forwarding scheme using
Neighbor Watch System (NWS), specifically designed
for hop-by-hop reliable delivery in face of malicious nodes
that drop relaying packets, as well as faulty nodes that
fail to relay packets. Unlike previous work with multipath
data forwarding, our scheme basically employs single-path
data forwarding, which consumes less power than multipath
schemes. As the packet is forwarded along the single-path
toward the base station, our scheme, however, converts into
multipath data forwarding at the location where NWS detects
relaying nodes' misbehavior. Simulation experiments
show that, with the help of NWS, our forwarding scheme
achieves a high success ratio in face of a large number of
packet-dropping nodes, and effectively adjusts its forwarding
style, depending on the number of packet-dropping nodes
en-route to the base station.
