GraalBench: A 3D Graphics Benchmark Suite for Mobile Phones
ABSTRACT
In this paper we consider implementations of embedded 3D graphics
and provide evidence indicating that 3D benchmarks employed
for desktop computers are not suitable for mobile environments.
Consequently, we present GraalBench, a set of 3D graphics workloads
representative for contemporary and emerging mobile devices
. In addition, we present detailed simulation results for a
typical rasterization pipeline. The results show that the proposed
benchmarks use only a part of the resources offered by current 3D
graphics libraries. For instance, while each benchmark uses the
texturing unit for more than 70% of the generated fragments, the
alpha unit is employed for less than 13% of the fragments. The
Fog unit was used for 84% of the fragments by one benchmark, but
the other benchmarks did not use it at all. Our experiments on the
proposed suite suggest that the texturing, depth and blending units
should be implemented in hardware, while, for instance, the dithering
unit may be omitted from a hardware implementation. Finally,
we discuss the architectural implications of the obtained results for
hardware implementations.
