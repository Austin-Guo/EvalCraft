Machine Learning in Low-level Microarray Analysis
ABSTRACT
Machine learning and data mining have found a multitude
of successful applications in microarray analysis, with gene
clustering and classification of tissue samples being widely
cited examples. Low-level microarray analysis - often associated
with the pre-processing stage within the microarray
life-cycle - has increasingly become an area of active
research, traditionally involving techniques from classical
statistics. This paper explores opportunities for the application
of machine learning and data mining methods to several
important low-level microarray analysis problems: monitoring
gene expression, transcript discovery, genotyping and resequencing
. Relevant methods and ideas from the machine
learning community include semi-supervised learning, learning
from heterogeneous data, and incremental learning.
