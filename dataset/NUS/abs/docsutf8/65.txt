dBBlue: Low Diameter and Self-routing Bluetooth Scatternet
ABSTRACT
This paper addresses the problem of scatternet formation for single-hop
Bluetooth based ad hoc networks, with minimal communication
overhead. We adopt the well-known structure de Bruijn graph
to form the backbone of Bluetooth scatternet, hereafter called dBBlue
, such that every master node has at most seven slaves, every
slave node is in at most two piconets, and no node assumes both
master and slave roles. Our structure dBBlue also enjoys a nice
routing property: the diameter of the graph is  
业
and we can
find a path with at most   
业
hops for every pair of nodes without
any routing table . Moreover, the congestion of every node is
at most  
业
, assuming that a unit of total traffic demand
is equally distributed among all pair of nodes. We discuss in detail
a vigorous method to locally update the structure dBBlue using
at most    
业
communications when a node joins or leaves the
network. In most cases, the cost of updating the scatternet is actually
 
   
since a node can join or leave without affecting the
remaining scatternet. The number of nodes affected when a node
joins or leaves the network is always bounded from above by a constant
. To facilitate self-routing and easy updating, we design a scalable
MAC assigning mechanism for piconet, which guarantees the
packet delivery during scatternet updating. The dBBlue scatternet
can be constructed incrementally when the nodes join the network
one by one. Previously no method can guarantee all these properties
although some methods can achieve some of the properties.
