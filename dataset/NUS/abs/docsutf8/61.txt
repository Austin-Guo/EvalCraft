Coverage Directed Test Generation for Functional Verification using Bayesian Networks
ABSTRACT
Functional verification is widely acknowledged as the bottleneck
in the hardware design cycle. This paper addresses one of the
main challenges of simulation based verification (or dynamic verification
), by providing a new approach for Coverage Directed Test
Generation (CDG). This approach is based on Bayesian networks
and computer learning techniques. It provides an efficient way for
closing a feedback loop from the coverage domain back to a generator
that produces new stimuli to the tested design. In this paper, we
show how to apply Bayesian networks to the CDG problem. Applying
Bayesian networks to the CDG framework has been tested in
several experiments, exhibiting encouraging results and indicating
that the suggested approach can be used to achieve CDG goals.
