Ranking Flows from Sampled Traffic
ABSTRACT
Most of the theoretical work on sampling has addressed the
inversion of general traffic properties such as flow size distribution
, average flow size, or total number of flows. In
this paper, we make a step towards understanding the impact
of packet sampling on individual flow properties. We
study how to detect and rank the largest flows on a link. To
this end, we develop an analytical model that we validate
on real traces from two networks. First we study a blind
ranking method where only the number of sampled packets
from each flow is known. Then, we propose a new method,
protocol-aware ranking, where we make use of the packet
sequence number (when available in transport header) to
infer the number of non-sampled packets from a flow, and
hence to improve the ranking. Surprisingly, our analytical
and experimental results indicate that a high sampling rate
(10% and even more depending on the number of top flows
to be ranked) is required for a correct blind ranking of the
largest flows. The sampling rate can be reduced by an order
of magnitude if one just aims at detecting these flows or by
using the protocol-aware method.
