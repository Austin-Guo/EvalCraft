Sparsha: A Comprehensive Indian Language Toolset for the Blind
ABSTRACT
Braille and audio feedback based systems have vastly improved the 
lives of the visually impaired across a wide majority of the globe. 
However, more than 13 million visually impaired people in the 
Indian sub-continent could not benefit much from such systems. 
This was primarily due to the difference in the technology required 
for Indian languages compared to those corresponding to other 
popular languages of the world. In this paper, we describe the 
Sparsha toolset. The contribution made by this research has enabled 
the visually impaired to read and write in Indian vernaculars with 
the help of a computer.
