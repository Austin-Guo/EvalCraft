A Similarity Measure for Motion Stream Segmentation and Recognition
ABSTRACT
Recognition of motion streams such as data streams generated
by different sign languages or various captured human
body motions requires a high performance similarity measure
. The motion streams have multiple attributes, and motion
patterns in the streams can have different lengths from
those of isolated motion patterns and different attributes
can have different temporal shifts and variations. To address
these issues, this paper proposes a similarity measure
based on singular value decomposition (SVD) of motion matrices
. Eigenvector differences weighed by the corresponding
eigenvalues are considered for the proposed similarity measure
. Experiments with general hand gestures and human
motion streams show that the proposed similarity measure
gives good performance for recognizing motion patterns in
the motion streams in real time.
