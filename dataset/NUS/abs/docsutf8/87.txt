Evaluation and Evolution of a Browse and Search Interface: Relation Browser++
ABSTRACT
We present in this paper the design and an evaluation of a novel 
interface called the Relation Browser++ (RB++) for searching 
and browsing large information collections. RB++ provides 
visualized category overviews of an information space and 
allows dynamic filtering and exploration of the result set by 
tightly coupling the browsing and searching functions. A user 
study was conducted to compare the effectiveness, efficiency 
and user satisfaction of completing various types of searching 
and browsing using the RB++ interface and a traditional form-fillin
interface for a video library. An exploration set of tasks 
was also included to examine the effectiveness of and user 
satisfaction with the RB++ when applied to a large federal 
statistics website. The comparison study strongly supported that 
RB++ was more effective, efficient, and satisfying for 
completing data exploration tasks.  Based on the results, efforts 
to automatically populate the underlying database using machine 
learning techniques are underway.  Preliminary implementations 
for two large-scale federal statistical websites have been 
installed on government servers for internal evaluation.
