Implementing the IT Fundamentals Knowledge Area
ABSTRACT
The recently promulgated IT model curriculum contains IT 
fundamentals as one of its knowledge areas. It is intended to give 
students a broad understanding of (1) the IT profession and the 
skills that students must develop to become successful IT 
professionals and (2) the academic discipline of IT and its 
relationship to other disciplines. As currently defined, the IT 
fundamentals knowledge area requires 33 lecture hours to 
complete. 
The model curriculum recommends that the material relevant to 
the IT fundamentals knowledge area be offered early in the 
curriculum, for example in an introduction to IT course; however, 
many institutions will have to include additional material in an 
introductory IT course. For example, the Introduction of IT course 
at Georgia Southern University is used to introduce students to 
the available second disciplines (an important part of the Georgia 
Southern IT curriculum aimed at providing students with in-depth 
knowledge of an IT application domain), some productivity tools, 
and SQL. 
For many programs there may be too much material in an 
introductory IT course. This paper describes how Georgia 
Southern University resolved this dilemma.
