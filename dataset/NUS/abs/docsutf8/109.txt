Index Structures and Algorithms for Querying Distributed RDF Repositories
ABSTRACT
A technical infrastructure for storing, querying and managing RDF
data is a key element in the current semantic web development.
Systems like Jena, Sesame or the ICS-FORTH RDF Suite are widely
used for building semantic web applications. Currently, none of
these systems supports the integrated querying of distributed RDF
repositories. We consider this a major shortcoming since the semantic
web is distributed by nature. In this paper we present an architecture
for querying distributed RDF repositories by extending
the existing Sesame system. We discuss the implications of our architecture
and propose an index structure as well as algorithms for
query processing and optimization in such a distributed context.
