Agent Technology for Personalized Information Filtering: The PIA-System
ABSTRACT
As today the amount of accessible information is overwhelming, 
the intelligent and personalized filtering of available information 
is a main challenge. Additionally, there is a growing need for the 
seamless mobile and multi-modal system usage throughout the 
whole day to meet the requirements of the modern society 
("anytime, anywhere, anyhow"). A personal information agent 
that is delivering the right information at the right time by 
accessing, filtering and presenting information in a situation-aware
matter is needed. Applying Agent-technology is promising, 
because the inherent capabilities of agents like autonomy, pro- 
and reactiveness offer an adequate approach. We developed an 
agent-based personal information system called PIA for 
collecting, filtering, and integrating information at a common 
point, offering access to the information by WWW, e-mail, SMS, 
MMS, and J2ME clients. Push and pull techniques are combined 
allowing the user to search explicitly for specific information on 
the one hand and to be informed automatically about relevant 
information divided in pre-, work and recreation slots on the 
other hand. In the core of the PIA system advanced filtering 
techniques are deployed through multiple filtering agent 
communities for content-based and collaborative filtering. 
Information-extracting agents are constantly gathering new 
relevant information from a variety of selected sources (internet, 
files, databases, web-services etc.). A personal agent for each 
user is managing the individual information provisioning, 
tailored to the needs of this specific user, knowing the profile, 
the current situation and learning from feedback.
