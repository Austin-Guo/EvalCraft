A Geometric Constraint Library for 3D Graphical Applications
ABSTRACT
Recent computer technologies have enabled fast high-quality
3D graphics on personal computers, and also have made
the development of 3D graphical applications easier. However
, most of such technologies do not sufficiently support
layout and behavior aspects of 3D graphics. Geometric constraints
are, in general, a powerful tool for specifying layouts
and behaviors of graphical objects, and have been applied
to 2D graphical user interfaces and specialized 3D graphics
packages. In this paper, we present Chorus3D, a geometric
constraint library for 3D graphical applications. It
enables programmers to use geometric constraints for various
purposes such as geometric layout, constrained dragging,
and inverse kinematics. Its novel feature is to handle scene
graphs by processing coordinate transformations in geometric
constraint satisfaction. We demonstrate the usefulness of
Chorus3D by presenting sample constraint-based 3D graphical
applications.
