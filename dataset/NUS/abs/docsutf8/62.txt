Creating a Massive Master Index for HTML and Print
ABSTRACT
An index connects readers with information. Creating an index for 
a single book is a time-honored craft. Creating an index for a 
massive library of HTML topics is a modern craft that has largely 
been discarded in favor of robust search engines. The authors 
show how they optimized a single-sourced index for collections of 
HTML topics, printed books, and PDF books. With examples 
from a recent index of 24,000 entries for 7,000 distinct HTML 
topics also published as 40 different PDF books, the authors 
discuss the connections between modern technology and 
traditional information retrieval methods that made the index 
possible, usable, and efficient to create and maintain.
