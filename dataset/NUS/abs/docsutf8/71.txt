Discovering and Ranking Web Services with BASIL: A Personalized Approach with Biased Focus
ABSTRACT
In this paper we present a personalized web service discovery
and ranking technique for discovering and ranking relevant
data-intensive web services. Our first prototype   called BASIL
  supports a personalized view of da-a-intensive web services
through source-biased focus. BASIL provides service discovery
and ranking through source-biased probing and source-biased
relevance metrics. Concretely, the BASIL approach has three
unique features: (1) It is able to determine in very few interactions
whether a target service is relevant to the given source
service by probing the target with very precise probes; (2) It
can evaluate and rank the relevant services discovered based on
a set of source-biased relevance metrics; and (3) It can identify
interesting types of relationships for each source service
with respect to other discovered services, which can be used
as value-added metadata for each service. We also introduce a
performance optimization technique called source-biased probing
with focal terms to further improve the effectiveness of the
basic source-biased service discovery algorithm. The paper concludes
with a set of initial experiments showing the effectiveness
of the BASIL system.
