Robustness Analysis of Cognitive Information Complexity Measure using Weyuker Properties
Abstract
Cognitive information complexity measure is based on cognitive 
informatics, which helps in comprehending the software 
characteristics. For any complexity measure to be robust, Weyuker 
properties must be satisfied to qualify as good and comprehensive 
one. In this paper, an attempt has also been made to evaluate 
cognitive information complexity measure in terms of nine 
Weyuker properties, through examples. It has been found that all 
the nine properties have been satisfied by cognitive information 
complexity measure and hence establishes cognitive information 
complexity measure based on information contained in the 
software as a robust and well-structured one.
