Learning Query Languages of Web Interfaces
ABSTRACT
This paper studies the problem of automatic acquisition of
the query languages supported by a Web information resource
. We describe a system that automatically probes the
search interface of a resource with a set of test queries and
analyses the returned pages to recognize supported query
operators.
The automatic acquisition assumes the availability
of the number of matches the resource returns for
a submitted query. The match numbers are used to train
a learning system and to generate classification rules that
recognize the query operators supported by a provider and
their syntactic encodings. These classification rules are employed
during the automatic probing of new providers to
determine query operators they support. We report on results
of experiments with a set of real Web resources.
