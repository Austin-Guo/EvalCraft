A Flexible 3D Slicer for Voxelization Using Graphics Hardware
Abstract
In this paper we present a simple but general 3D slicer for voxelizing
polygonal model. Instead of voxelizing a model by projecting
and rasterizing triangles with clipping planes, the distance field is
used for more accurate and stable voxelization. Distance transform
is used with triangles on voxels of each slice. A voxel is marked
with opacity only when the shortest distance between it and triangles
is judged as intersection. With advanced programmable graphics
hardware assistance, surface and solid voxelization are feasible
and more efficient than on a CPU.
