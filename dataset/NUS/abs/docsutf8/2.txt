This paper shows the importance that management plays in the 
protection of information and in the planning to handle a security 
breach when a theft of information happens.  Recent thefts of 
information that have hit major companies have caused concern.   
These thefts were caused by companies' inability to determine 
risks associated with the protection of their data and these 
companies lack of planning to properly manage a security breach 
when it occurs.  It is becoming necessary, if not mandatory, for 
organizations to perform ongoing risk analysis to protect their 
systems.  Organizations need to realize that the theft of 
information is a management issue as well as a technology one, 
and that these recent security breaches were mainly caused by 
business decisions by management and not a lack of technology.
