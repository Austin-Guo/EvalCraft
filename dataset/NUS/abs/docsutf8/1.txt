2-Source Dispersers for Sub-Polynomial Entropy and Ramsey Graphs Beating the Frankl-Wilson Construction
ABSTRACT
The main result of this paper is an explicit disperser for two
independent sources on n bits, each of entropy k = n
o(1)
.
Put differently, setting N = 2
n
and K = 2
k
, we construct
explicit N x N Boolean matrices for which no K x K sub-matrix
is monochromatic. Viewed as adjacency matrices of
bipartite graphs, this gives an explicit construction of K-Ramsey
bipartite graphs of size N .
This greatly improves the previous bound of k = o(n) of
Barak, Kindler, Shaltiel, Sudakov and Wigderson [4]. It also
significantly improves the 25-year record of k = ~
O(n) on
the special case of Ramsey graphs, due to Frankl and Wilson
[9].
The construction uses (besides "classical" extractor ideas)
almost all of the machinery developed in the last couple of
years for extraction from independent sources, including:
 .Bourgain's extractor for 2 independent sources of some
entropy rate &lt; 1/2 [5]
 .Raz's extractor for 2 independent sources, one of which
has any entropy rate &gt; 1/2 [18]

.The "Challenge-Response" mechanism for detecting
"entropy concentration" of [4].
The main novelty comes in a bootstrap procedure which
allows the Challenge-Response mechanism of [4] to be used
with sources of less and less entropy, using recursive calls
to itself. Subtleties arise since the success of this mechanism
depends on restricting the given sources, and so recursion
constantly changes the original sources. These are
resolved via a new construct, in between a disperser and
an extractor, which behaves like an extractor on sufficiently
large subsources of the given ones.
