Very Low Complexity MPEG-2 to H.264 Transcoding Using Machine Learning
ABSTRACT
This paper presents a novel macroblock mode decision algorithm 
for inter-frame prediction based on machine learning techniques 
to be used as part of a very low complexity MPEG-2 to H.264 
video transcoder. Since coding mode decisions take up the most 
resources in video transcoding, a fast macro block (MB) mode 
estimation would lead to reduced complexity. The proposed 
approach is based on the hypothesis that MB coding mode 
decisions in H.264 video have a correlation with the distribution 
of the motion compensated residual in MPEG-2 video. We use 
machine learning tools to exploit the correlation and derive 
decision trees to classify the incoming MPEG-2 MBs into one of 
the 11 coding modes in H.264. The proposed approach reduces 
the H.264 MB mode computation process into a decision tree 
lookup with very low complexity. The proposed transcoder is 
compared with a reference transcoder comprised of a MPEG-2 
decoder and an H.264 encoder. Our results show that the proposed 
transcoder reduces the H.264 encoding time by over 95% with 
negligible loss in quality and bitrate.
