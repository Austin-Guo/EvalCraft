Ranking Target Objects of Navigational Queries
ABSTRACT
Web navigation plays an important role in exploring public
interconnected data sources such as life science data. A
navigational query in the life science graph produces a result
graph which is a layered directed acyclic graph (DAG).
Traversing the result paths in this graph reaches a target
object set (TOS). The challenge for ranking the target objects
is to provide recommendations that reflect the relative
importance of the retrieved object, as well as its relevance to
the specific query posed by the scientist. We present a metric
layered graph PageRank (lgPR) to rank target objects
based on the link structure of the result graph. LgPR is
a modification of PageRank; it avoids random jumps to respect
the path structure of the result graph. We also outline
a metric layered graph ObjectRank (lgOR) which extends
the metric ObjectRank to layered graphs. We then present
an initial evaluation of lgPR. We perform experiments on
a real-world graph of life sciences objects from NCBI and
report on the ranking distribution produced by lgPR. We
compare lgPR with PageRank. In order to understand the
characteristics of lgPR, an expert compared the Top K target
objects (publications in the PubMed source) produced
by lgPR and a word-based ranking method that uses text
features extracted from an external source (such as Entrez
Gene) to rank publications.
