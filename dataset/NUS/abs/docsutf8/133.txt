Machine Learning in DNA Microarray Analysis for Cancer Classification
Abstract
The development of microarray technology has supplied a large 
volume of data to many fields. In particular, it has been applied 
to prediction and diagnosis of cancer, so that it expectedly helps 
us to exactly predict and diagnose cancer. To precisely classify 
cancer we have to select genes related to cancer because 
extracted genes from microarray have many noises. In this paper, 
we attempt to explore many features and classifiers using three 
benchmark datasets to systematically evaluate the performances 
of the feature selection methods and machine learning classifiers. 
Three benchmark datasets are Leukemia cancer dataset, Colon 
cancer dataset and Lymphoma cancer data set. Pearson's and 
Spearman's correlation coefficients, Euclidean distance, cosine 
coefficient, information gain, mutual information and signal to 
noise ratio have been used for feature selection. Multi-layer 
perceptron, k-nearest neighbour, support vector machine and 
structure adaptive self organizing map have been used for 
classification. Also, we have combined the classifiers to improve 
the performance of classification. Experimental results show that 
the ensemble with several basis classifiers produces the best 
recognition rate on the benchmark dataset.
