Coupling and Cohesion Measures for Evaluation of Component Reusability
ABSTRACT
This paper provides an account of new measures of coupling and 
cohesion developed to assess the reusability of Java components 
retrieved from the internet by a search engine. These measures 
differ from the majority of established metrics in two respects: 
they reflect the degree to which entities are coupled or resemble 
each other, and they take account of indirect couplings or 
similarities. An empirical comparison of the new measures with 
eight established metrics shows the new measures are consistently 
superior at ranking components according to their reusability.
