A Pseudo Random Coordinated Scheduling Algorithm for Bluetooth Scatternets
ABSTRACT
The emergence of Bluetooth as a default radio interface allows
handheld devices to be rapidly interconnected into ad hoc networks.
Bluetooth allows large numbers of piconets to form a scatternet using
designated nodes that participate in multiple piconets. A unit
that participates in multiple piconets can serve as a bridge and forwards
traffic between neighbouring piconets. Since a Bluetooth
unit can transmit or receive in only one piconet at a time, a bridging
unit has to share its time among the different piconets. To schedule
communication with bridging nodes one must take into account
their availability in the different piconets, which represents a difficult
, scatternet wide coordination problem and can be an important
performance bottleneck in building scatternets. In this paper
we propose the Pseudo-Random Coordinated Scatternet Scheduling
(PCSS) algorithm to perform the scheduling of both intra and
inter-piconet communication. In this algorithm Bluetooth nodes
assign meeting points with their peers such that the sequence of
meeting points follows a pseudo random process that is different
for each pair of nodes. The uniqueness of the pseudo random sequence
guarantees that the meeting points with different peers of
the node will collide only occasionally. This removes the need
for explicit information exchange between peer devices, which is
a major advantage of the algorithm. The lack of explicit signaling
between Bluetooth nodes makes it easy to deploy the PCSS algorithm
in Bluetooth devices, while conformance to the current Bluetooth
specification is also maintained. To assess the performance of
the algorithm we define two reference case schedulers and perform
simulations in a number of scenarios where we compare the performance
of PCSS to the performance of the reference schedulers.
