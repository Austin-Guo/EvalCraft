SmartCrawl: A New Strategy for the Exploration of the Hidden Web
ABSTRACT
The way current search engines work leaves a large amount
of information available in the World Wide Web outside
their catalogues. This is due to the fact that crawlers work
by following hyperlinks and a few other references and ignore
HTML forms. In this paper, we propose a search engine
prototype that can retrieve information behind HTML
forms by automatically generating queries for them. We describe
the architecture, some implementation details and an
experiment that proves that the information is not in fact
indexed by current search engines.
