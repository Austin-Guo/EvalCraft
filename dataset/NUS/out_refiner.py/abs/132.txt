In particular
, our work analyzes a particular digital library  the
website of the Bureau of Labor Statistics
2
(BLS)  in efforts
to discover a small number of linguistically meaningful concepts
, or "bins," that collectively summarize the semantic
domain of the site.
Altogether, the link structure of this classificatory
system contains 65 documents; that is, excluding
navigational links, there are 65 documents linked from the
BLS home page, where each hyperlink connects a document
to a topic (pages can be linked to multiple topics).
Specif ically
, using k means, we clustered each of the 1279 documents
into one of k clusters, with the number of clusters
chosen by analyzing the within cluster mean squared distance
at different values of k (see Section 6.1).
Topics based on full text documents were derived by application
of k means clustering to the 1279 Editor's Desk documents
, where each document was represented by a 1908 dimensional
vector.

, the augmented model is significantly inferior to the
model trained solely on Editor's Desk documents if we concern
ourselves only with documents selected by the majority
of human reviewers  i.e. only first choice classes.

on a statistical model of these topics, the second phase of
our approach uses supervised learning (in particular, a naive
Bayes classifier, trained on individual words), to assign topical
relations to the remaining documents in the collection.
