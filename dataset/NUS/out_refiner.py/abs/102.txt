Additional
views, whether as insets <A href="102.html#8">[20], separate objects like mirrors
<A href="102.html#8">[8], or in form of lenses and volumetric cursors changing
the rendition of embedded structures <A href="102.html#8">[7, 21, 23], are either
not close enough to the manipulated structures to be fully
recognized without dividing the users attention between
different views <A href="102.html#8">[13] or require sometimes tedious manipulations
to be placed or moved within the scene.
In this paper we present an approach called Illustrative
Shadows that provides an intuitive, visual link between an
actively manipulated 3D visualization and a supplemental
2D information display integrating them into one combined
information display (see <A href="102.html#1">Figure 1).
Interactions are
tracked and ranked within an interaction history to
communicate the current interaction context via a client
interface to an external knowledge based component.
.
As a result of the integrated 3D/2D visualization, interaction
is possible within the 3D visualization as well as
in the projection layers, a technique inspired by <A href="102.html#8">[10].
The knowledge base was created by manually analyzing
several anatomy textbooks, anatomy atlases, medical dictionaries
, and lexica.
The has Part* relation represents the transitive hull over
several spatial part of relations <A href="102.html#7">[1] (e.g. the has Basis relation
between Bones and Bone Volumes and the has Area relation
between Areas or Volumes and Areas).
