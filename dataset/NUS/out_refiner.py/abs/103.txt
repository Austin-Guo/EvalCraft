In this technique, keywords
extracted from the user's search query are matched against
keywords associated with ads provided by advertisers.
Our results indicate that a strategy that
matches the ad plus its keywords to a Web page, requiring
the keywords to appear in the Web page, provides improvements
in average precision figures of roughly 60% relative
to a strategy that simply matches the ads to the Web page.
Given our triggering page p and a set A of ads, a simple
way of ranking a
i
A with regard to p is by matching the
contents of p to the contents of a
i
.
Let
w
iq
be the weight associated with term t
i
in the query q
and w
ij
be the weight associated with term t
i
in the document
d
j
.
Given that (a
i
, h
i
)  H and (a
i
, k
i
)  K, we have our
last two methods:
AAK H(p, a
i
) =
sim(p, a
i
h
i
k
i
)
if k
i
p
0
if otherwise
AAK EXP H(p, a
i
) =
sim(p  r, a
i
h
i
k
i
)
if k
i
(p  r)
0
if otherwise
where AAK H stands for "match ads and keywords also considering
the page pointed by the ad" and AAH EXP H stands
for "match ads and keywords with expanded triggering page,
also considering the page pointed by the ad".
We expand triggering pages with terms extracted from the
Web collection and then we match these expanded pages to
the ads from the advertisement collection.
