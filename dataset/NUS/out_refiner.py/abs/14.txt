Hawking et al [17] made ten suggestions on how to conduct high 
quality intranet search.
Given a query, we used the following information to deduce the 
underlying search need:
the query itself 
  the documents returned by the search engine 
  the documents clicked on by the user
For example, if a user typed a keyword of `.net' and clicked a 
homepage of .net, then we judged that the user was looking for a 
homepage of .net.
However, it is difficult to find expert 
searches from query log at a conventional search engine, because 
users understand that such search is not supported and they do not 
conduct the search.
