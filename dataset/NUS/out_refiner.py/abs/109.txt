Despite the inherently distributed nature of the semantic web, most
current RDF infrastructures (for example [4]) store information locally
as a single knowledge repository, i.e., RDF models from remote
sources are replicated locally and merged into a single model.
In this work, we assume that local repositories are implemented
using database systems that translate queries posed to the RDF API
into SQL queries and use the database functionality to evaluate
them (compare [5]).
The easiest way of guaranteeing this is to use a simple
tree recursion algorithm that retrieves results for the complete path,
then splits the original path, and joins the results of recursive calls
for the sub paths.

Note that Algorithm 1 is far from being optimal with respect to
runtime performance.
First is the cost of data transmission
to the mediator, and second is the data processing cost.
