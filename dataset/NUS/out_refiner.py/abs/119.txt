However, we added additional
formatting and iconic graphics/images as found 
in awareness displays such as Sideshow [3] to differentiate
this display from the Text based display.
The Web Portal display used an area of 968 pixels 
wide by 386 pixels high on the display.
A recall questionnaire
was placed text side down in front of the participant
and then an information display was shown for 
eight seconds.

This study, however, confirms our intuition 
that the InfoCanvas, and displays like it, has potential to 
be an effective peripheral display where people seek to 
obtain information at a glance.
The mappings between information and graphical elements
used in this study were designed by the authors, 
and as such, did not always feel instinctive to participants
.
Pilot studies 
and the final study data both indicated that despite not 
being able to define their own mappings for the information
, participants were able to recall more information
when presented on the InfoCanvas.
We present results indicating that 
participants comprehended and recalled more awareness
information when it was represented in graphical 
manners; participants recalled more information from 
the InfoCanvas display than the Web Portal and Text based
displays.
