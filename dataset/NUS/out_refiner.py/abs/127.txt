For low end accelerators, only portions of the pixel drawing stages
of the pipeline are in hardware; the floating point intensive parts of
the pipe are processed by the host in software.
Restart corresponds to a "move" operation in
polylines, and allows multiple unconnected variable length triangle
strips to be described by a single data structure passed in by the user,

illusion that individual instructions are executed in one shot.
Mathematically, each chip thinks it is rasterizing the triangle
into an image memory with valid pixel centers only every five original
pixels horizontally, with each chip starting off biased one more
pixel to the right.
Therefore, when rendering 3D lines, Leo
employs a high accuracy DDA algorithm, using 32 bits internally
for sufficient subpixel precision.
Triangles need
single pixel cycle edge walking hardware in parallel with RGBZ
span interpolation hardware.
Isolated 10 pixel antialiased, constant color, Z buffered, depth cued
lines (which are actually 12 pixels long due to endpoint ramps, and
three pixels wide) render at a 422K per second rate.
Complete
images of simulated rendering were generated throughout the
course of the project, from within weeks of its start.
