Lewandowski et al.
[17] studied how frequently Google,
MSN and Yahoo updated their cached versions of web pages,
but we are unaware of any research that attempts to measure
how quickly new resources are added to and removed
from commercial SE caches, or research that explores the
use of SE caches for reconstructing websites.
We could have queried the SEs using the URL for
each resource, but this might have led to our resources being
cached prematurely; it is possible that if a SE is queried
for a URL it did not index that it would add the URL to a
list of URLs to be crawled at a later date.
As Figure 2 illustrates, both Google and MSN were quick
to make resources available in their cache soon after they
were crawled, and they were quick to purge resources from
their cache when a crawl revealed the resources were no
longer available on the web server.
We have also observed that cached resources are
often purged from all three caches as soon as a crawl reveals
the resources are missing, but in the case of Google,
many HTML resources have reappeared weeks after being
removed.
Shingling (as proposed by Broder et al. [3]) is a popular
method for quantifying similarity of text documents when
word order is important [2, 11, 21].
