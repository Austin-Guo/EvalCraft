We present the first external memory index for multidimensional
trajectories, that supports multiple distance
functions (such as LCSS, DTW and Euclidean), without the
need to rebuild the index.
The flexibility provided by DTW is very important, however
its efficiency deteriorates for noisy data, since by matching
all the points, it also matches the outliers distorting the
true distance between the sequences.
The basic idea is
to match two sequences by allowing them to stretch, without
rearranging the order of the elements but allowing some
elements to be unmatched.
We describe an extension in 2D of the original DTW function
as described by Berndt and Clifford [4].
A
similar greedy split algorithm is also used for splitting the
MBE of the query trajectory Q.

Equi Split, 8 MBRs, Gain = 5.992
(b)
Equi Split, 9 MBRs, Gain = 5.004
(c)
Greedy Split, 8MBRs, Gain = 9.157
(d)
Greedy Split, 9MBRs, Gain = 10.595
Figure 7: (a): 8 MBRs produced using equi Split.
The equi split
offers slightly better results, than producing MBRs at random
positions.
