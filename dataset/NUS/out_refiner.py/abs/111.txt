A key component of
REAP is an advanced search model that can find documents
satisfying a set of diverse and possibly complex lexical
constraints, including a passage's topic, reading level (e.g. 3rd
grade), use of syntax (simple vs. complex sentence structures),
and vocabulary that is known or unknown to the student.
Annotations are currently stored as Lemur
properties, but later versions will take advantage of the
enhancements planned for support of rich document structure,
described in Section 2.3.
The
text should use both passive  and active voice
sentence constructions and should introduce about
10% new vocabulary relative to the student's
known vocabulary model.
The page's topic is less
important than finding pages that practice the words:
for example, an article on another sport that satisfies
the other constraints would also be acceptable.
Information needs in REAP will be modeled as mixtures of
multiple word histograms, representing different sources of
evidence, as well as document level or passage level
constraints on attributes such as reading difficulty.
For example, we model the curriculum as a
word histogram.
The
adult studies will provide feedback on vocabulary matching
and comprehension, and the child studies will test the
hypothesis that children will read adaptively to texts that vary
in vocabulary demands, where those texts that closely reflect
the reader's interests and comprehension can be used to
support improved comprehension and vocabulary growth.
