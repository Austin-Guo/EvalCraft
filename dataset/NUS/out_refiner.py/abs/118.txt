Today, most radio technologies
considered by WPANs (Bluetooth Special Interest
Group [2], and IEEE 802.15) employ the 2.4 GHz ISM frequency
band, which is also used by Local Area Network
(WLAN) devices implementing the IEEE 802.11b standard
specifications [9].

Figure 2. WLAN frame transmission scheme.
Consider that the desired packet is from
the WLAN and the interference packets are Bluetooth (the
figure is equally valid if the roles are reversed, except that
the frequencies of the packets will be different).
Next, we consider the effect of increasing the WLAN
transmission power on the WLAN performance in scenario 2.
From figure 5(c), we observe that even if the WLAN transmission
power is fifty times more than the Bluetooth transmission
power (fixed at 1 mW), the packet loss for the WLAN
does not change.
In this case, we are looking at the effect of Bluetooth piconets
on the four WLAN sink devices.
