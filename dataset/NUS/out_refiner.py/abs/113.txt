While boundaries are blurred, most online networking
sites share a core of features: through the site an individual
offers a "profile"   a representation of their sel[ves] (and,
often, of their own social networks)   to others to peruse,
with the intention of contacting or being contacted by others
, to meet new friends or dates (Friendster,

Orkut
4
), find
new jobs (LinkedIn
5
), receive or provide recommendations
(Tribe
6
), and much more.
Second, while the number of strong ties that a person
may maintain on a social networking site may not be significantly
increased by online networking technology, Donath
and Boyd note that "the number of weak ties one can
form and maintain may be able to increase substantially,
because the type of communication that can be done more
cheaply and easily with new technology is well suited for
these ties" [9] (p. 80).
In an interview,
Tribe.net CEO Mark Pincus noted that "[s]ocial networking
has the potential to create an intelligent order in the current
chaos by letting you manage how public you make yourself
and why and who can contact you." [4].

Age distribution of Facebook profiles at CMU.
For any user of the Facebook, other users fall into four different
categories: friends, friends of friends, non friend users

We note that Friendster's profiles used to be populated
by numerous fake and/or humorous profiles, also called
"Fakesters" (see [8]).

Histogram of the size of networks for both CMU friends (a) and non CMU friends (b).
At CMU more than 2500 profiles fall in this category

. Potential de identified data sources include other
social networking sites (e.g. Friendster) or dating sites (e.g.
Match.com) that typically host anonymous profiles.
One might speculate that the perceived privacy protection
of making personal information available only to members
of a campus community may increase Facebook users' willingness
to reveal personal information.
