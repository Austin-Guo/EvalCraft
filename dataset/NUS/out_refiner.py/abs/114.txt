Google combines link based ranking
with page text and anchor text in undisclosed ways, and
keeps tweaking the combination, but suffers an occasional
embarrassment

Distillation has always been observed to work well for
"broad" topics (for which there exist well connected relevant
Web subgraphs and "pure" hubs) and not too well for
"narrow" topics, because w.r.t. narrow topics most hubs are
mixed and have too many irrelevant links.
The returned set of pages
R
q
was fetched from the Web, together with any pages having a
link to any page in
R
q
, as well as any page cited in some page
of
R
q
using a hyperlink.
Pages with large
a are popular or
authoritative sources of information; pages with large
h are
good collections of links.
Our
work establishes the value of a bipartite model like HITS,
and indeed, the value of an asymmetric model where hubs

Figure 3: (a) HITS, a macroscopic topic distillation algorithm
with uniform edge weights; (b) The B&H algorithm, apart from
using non uniform edge weights, discards pages in the expanded
set which are too dissimilar to the rootset pages to prevent topic
drift.
In our experience
small subtrees with small number of leaves dominate the
top ranks, again under aggregating hub scores and pitting
ancestor scores against descendant scores.
The set of HREF leaf nodes in the subtree rooted at
node
w is denoted L
w
, and the set of hub scores at these
leaves is denoted
H
w
.

affirmative action is not very popular, but adjoining DOM
subtrees (upper right corner) create a dense network of software
sites and mislead macroscopic distillation algorithms.
