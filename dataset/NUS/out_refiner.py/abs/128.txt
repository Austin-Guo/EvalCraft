The first bucket in each data 
segment contains a control index, which is a binary index
mapping a given key value to the segment containing that key, 
and a local index, which is an m entry index mapping a given key 
value to the buckets within the current segment.
The DAYS 
architecture [12] as shown in figure 1 consists of a Data Server, 
Broadcast Scheduler, DAYS Coordinator, Network of LEO 
satellites for global data delivery and a Local broadcast space.
For example, if
we have traffic, weather, and stock information are in broadcast 
then IC = {ic
traffic
, ic
weather
, and ic
stock
}.
It points to the sub indexes called the Minor index.
Wake up at the S
th
bucket and observe the Minor Index
8. end if 
  9. if bucket is Minor Index then 
10.  if Type
Requested
not equal to Type
found
and (A,R)
Request
not
equal to (A,R)
found
then
11.
As the 
number of internal locations vary for item to item (for example, 
Weather is generally associated with a City whereas traffic is 
granulated up to major and minor roads of a city), we argue that 
the structure of the location mapped information may be 
visualized as a forest which is a collection of general trees, the 
number of general trees depending on the types of information 
broadcasted and depth of a tree depending on the granularity of 
the location information associated with the information.
This large tuning time is due to the 
fact that after reaching the lowest minor index, the MU may have 
to access few buckets sequentially to get the required data bucket.
