In particular, the authors of [9] develop a distributed algorithm
called Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy
(LEACH) for homogeneous sensor networks where each sensor
elects itself as a cluster head with some probability and

An example of the wireless sensor data gathering networks.
A basic sensor node joins the
cluster whose cluster head is the closest in hops or distance to
this basic sensor node.
Because the signal
processing component usually consists of complicated
and expensive gear such as Digital Signal Proces sors
(DSP), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA),
etc., the basic sensor nodes do not contain the signal
processing component.
Notice that in the multi hop mode, the closer the distance
between the sensor node and its cluster head, the more energy
the sensor node consumes since the inner nodes are required

The basic sensor nodes will join the clusters in which
the cluster heads are the closest to the sensor nodes to form
Voronoi cells [14].

join any cluster head.
In our model, because the basic sensor nodes in the same
zone will consume almost the same energy in each round
(i.e., sharing the same relaying traffic load when multi hop
communication mode is used), their lifetimes are equal if
their initial energies are the same.
