In
the second case, the honest nodes can also reach each other,
and the adversarial node can also hear the nodes' communication
, i.e., he can send and receive messages to/from both
honest nodes.
We assume that transmitting a message
from the routing sublayer consists of passing the message to
the data link layer, which, after processing the message, also
passes it further to the physical layer.
Once the models are defined, the goal is to prove that
for any real world adversary, there exist an ideal world adversary
that can achieve essentially the same effects in the
ideal world model as those achieved by the real world adversary
in the real world model (i.e., the ideal world adversary
can simulate the real world adversary).
We
remark that this protocol has only been defined informally
that inspired us to present a new protocol, which provides
the "same" security as the authenticated routing protocol in
[14], but due to its simplicity it fits more in demonstrating
the usage of our model.
Moreover, the model proposed in [12] is based on CPAL ES,
and the model in [18] is similar to the strand spaces model.
The adversarial nodes belonging to the sensor class
nodes has the same resources and communication
capabilities as an ordinary sensor node, but a more resourced
adversarial node (e.g., laptops) may affect the
overall communication of an entire part of the network
depending on the power range of the resourced adversarial
device.
