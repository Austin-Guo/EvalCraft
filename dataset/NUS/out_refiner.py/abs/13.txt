Yoshida
et al.
proposed
a method to integrate WWW tables according to the
category of objects presented in each table 14].
It is inspired
by the fact that most genuine tables demonstrate certain
consistency either along the row or the column direction,
but usually not both, while non genuine tables often show
no consistency in either direction.
Based on the vector
space model, we de ne the similarity between weight vectors
representing genuine and non genuine tables and the
frequency vector representing the incoming table as the corresponding
dot products.
However, their data
sets either had limited manually annotated table data (
e.g.
,
918 table tags in 2], 75 HTML pages in 10], 175 manually
annotated table tags in 14]), or were collected from some
speci c domains (
e.g.
, a set of tables selected from airline
information pages were used in 2]).
Not every genuine table has its title and only 1,308 genuine
tables have table titles.

The output of each classi er is compared with the ground
truth and a contingency table is computed to indicate the
number of a particular class label that are identi ed as members
of one of two classes.
