Our algorithm
will assign each job to a unique machine    if a job j gets
assigned to a machine i, then j will get processed by machine
i only.
After this,
we show that the total waiting time of the jobs in the central
pool is also bounded by poly logarithmic factor times
the optimum's flow time.
Let us look at machines of class 1 to l   1.
We shall say that a job j is waiting
at time t in A if it is in the central pool at time t in A and
has been released before time t.
Let V
A
k
(t) denote the volume of jobs of class at most
k which are waiting at time t in A. Define V
O
k
(t) as the
remaining volume of jobs of class at most k which are active
at time t in O.
So the term

J(k, t)

G. Rinnooy Kan.
Since each job
in J
I
is of size at most
k
, we see that at least (
|M |) jobs
are waiting at time t. Summing over all values of t in the
range (t
