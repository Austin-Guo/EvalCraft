We 
term such rules as statistical quantitative rules (SQ rules).
With respect to learning SQ rules from data, we formulate the 
problem as learning significant SQ rules that have adequate 
support.
To address this we 
present an intuitive resampling technique that can determine the 
number of false rules, and argue that this number can be used to 
determine a &quot;false discovery rate&quot; for the learning procedure.

where  X is an itemset involving attributes in A only, D
X
is the
subset of D satisfying X, the function f computes some statistic 
from the values of the B attributes in the subset D
X
, and support is
the number of transactions in D satisfying X.
Quantitative association rules [2]:
population subset
mean or variance values for the subset (2.2)
Quantitative association rules are a popular representation for 
rules in the data mining literature in which the RHS of a rule 
represents the mean or variance of some attribute.
R. Such a permutation would create a dataset in
which  R

is independent of (R     R

), but would maintain the
distributions of R

and (R   R

) in the permutation dataset to be the
same as the distributions of these attributes in the original dataset.
Nonparametric methods are widely used on testing models that 
are built from data: as earliest in [18], the author uses 
randomization tests to tackle a model overfitting problem; [20] 
compares bootstrap and cross validation for model accuracy 
estimation; for decision trees, [14, 26] use permutation tests to 
select attributes based on 2
x2 contingency tables.

demonstrated that our approach can be used to learn interesting 
rules from data.
