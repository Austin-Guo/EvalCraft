Machine learning allows automatic creation of classifiers, 
however, the classical models are generally slow to train, and 
not interactive.
The classical machine learning (CML) model 
is summarized in Figure 1.
The user can then refine the classifier 
by adding more manual classification or, if the classifier is 
satisfactory, the user can export the classifier.
The 
sequence of images in Figure 5 shows the process of creating 
a classifier using Crayons.
As stated before, 
classification creation time for CWSS is longer than MSSS, 
but the center weighted algorithms tend to generalize better 
than the mean split algorithms.
It is clear from our 
evaluations that a classification algorithm must get under the 
10 20 second barrier in producing a new classification, but 
that once under that barrier, the designer's time begins to 
dominate.
Once the designer's time begins to dominate the 
total time, then the classifier with better generalization wins.
In actuality, 
because of the poor generalization of the mean split 
algorithm, even though the classifier generation time for 
MSSS was quicker than CWSS, the users felt it necessary to 
paint more using the MSSS, so the overall time increased 
using MSSS.
