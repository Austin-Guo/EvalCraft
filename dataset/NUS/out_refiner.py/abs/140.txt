Inspired by recently emerged viruses that
can spread over air interfaces, we identify in this paper
the threat of epidemic spreading of node compromises in
large scale wireless sensor networks and present a model
that captures the unique characteristic of wireless sensor
networks in conjunction with pairwise key schemes.
In particular, due to security schemes employed by
the sensor networks, we assume that communication can
only be performed when neighboring nodes can establish
mutual trust by authenticating a common key.
Therefore,
node compromise is not only determined by the deployment
of sensor nodes which in turn affects node density,
but also determined by the pairwise key scheme employed
therein.
We assume that a compromised node, by directly
communicating with a susceptible node, can spread the
infection and conduce to the compromise of the susceptible
node.
As the pairwise key scheme affects the communication
and hence the propagation of the node compromise, we
provide below, a brief overview of the key distribution
schemes in wireless sensor networks.
Epidemic theory indeed has been borrowed to the
networking field to investigate virus spreading.
A. Network Model as Random Graph
Assume that sensor nodes are uniformly deployed in
a disc area with radius
R. Let  =
N
R
2
denote the node
density of the network where
N is the total number of
the nodes.
The simulation
results for the case without recovery are shown
