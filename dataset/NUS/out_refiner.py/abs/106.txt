In this paper, we propose some improvements
of the search algorithm and the data structures of
TLAESA in order to reduce the number of distance
computations.
The search algorithm follows the best
first algorithm.
Then, the traversal of the search tree T starts
at the root node.
If the
inequality
d
min
+ r
t
&lt; d(q, p
t
)
(6)
is satisfied, we can see that no object exists in S
t
which is closer to q than p
min
and the traversal to
node t is not necessary.
In the
proposed structure, we treat such nodes as one node.
On
the other hand, the proposed method can reduce the
number of distance computations to some extent with
