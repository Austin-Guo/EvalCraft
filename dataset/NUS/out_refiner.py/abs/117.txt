Tuzhilin et. al. [23, 22, 29] worked on applying background
knowledge to finding interesting rules.
Even though applying the above definition and sorting
attribute sets on their interestingness works well in practice,
there might still be a large number of patterns retained,
especially if the background knowledge is not well developed
and large number of attribute sets have high interestingness
values.
An attribute set I is topologically
 interesting if it is  interesting, and there is no attribute
set J such that
1.
The algorithm for selecting the marginal distribution to
compute is motivated by the algorithm from [9] for computing
views that should be materialized for OLAP query
processing.
We used the UCI datasets and Bayesian networks
learned from data using B Course [26].
