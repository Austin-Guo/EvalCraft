The existing
sequential mining algorithms are not suitable for handling
this situation because the result mined from the old
database is no longer valid on the updated database, and it
is intolerably inefficient to mine the updated databases from
scratch.
This is because not only the appended items
may generate new locally frequent sequences in db, but
also that locally infrequent sequences may contribute their
occurrence count to the same infrequent sequences in the
original database to produce frequent ones.
Given a minimum support threshold,
min sup, a sequence is frequent if its support is no less
than min sup; given a factor u
1, a sequence is semi frequent
if its support is less than min sup but no less
than u
min sup; a sequence is infrequent if its support
is less than u
min sup.
If the prefix p is in F S or SF S, construct p projected
database and we will discover p in p projected database.
In sequential pattern mining, efficient algorithms like
GSP
[10],
SPADE [13], PrefixSpan [8], and SPAM [2] were developed
.
Partition [9] and FUP [3] are two algorithms which promote
partitioning the database, mining local frequent itemsets
, and then consolidating the global frequent itemsets by
cross check.
