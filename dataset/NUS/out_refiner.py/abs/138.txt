The 
Referral Web project [12] mined a social network from a wide 
variety of publicly available online information, and used it to 
help individuals find experts who could answer their questions 
based on geographical proximity.
In statistical Natural Language processing, one common way
of modeling the contributions of different topics to a document is 
to treat each topic as a probability distribution over words, 
viewing a document as a probability distribution over words, and 
thus viewing a document as a probabilistic mixture over these 
topics.
In a recent 
unpublished work, McCallum et al. [26] further extend the AT 
model to the Author Recipient Topic model by regarding the 
sender receiver pair as an additional author variable for topic 
classification.
Flow: A 
personal social network information flow illustrates how the 
information flows over a person's personal social network to 
other people's personal social networks 
Definition 6: Personal Topic Community Information Flow: A 
personal Topic CommunityNet information flow illustrates how 
the information about one topic flows over a person's personal 
social network to other people's personal social networks.
For each personal 
social network in one time period t, we use the exponential 
random graph model [17] to estimate an underlying distribution to 
describe the social network.
