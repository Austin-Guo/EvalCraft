Smola and Kondor showed some theoretical
understanding between kernel and regularization based
on the graph theory [21].
Belkin et al. developed a framework
for regularization on graphs and provided some analysis
on generalization error bounds [1].
In this section, we present the framework of learning the
unified kernel machines by combining supervised kernel machines
, semi supervised kernel learning and active learning
techniques into a unified solution.
Among all the compared kernels, the
semi supervised kernels by our spectral kernel learning algorithms
achieve the best performances.
The semi supervised
kernel initialized with an RBF kernel outperforms other kernels
in most cases.
The upper row shows the test set accuracy with standard
error; the lower row gives the average time used in learning the semi supervised kernels ("Order" and "Imp Order"
kernels are sovled by SeDuMi/YALMIP package; "SKL" kernels are solved directly by the Matlab
quadprog function.
