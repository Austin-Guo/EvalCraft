Research labs armed with microarrays have been able to
partake in a range of studies, including finding gene function
[35; 36; 37]; correcting mistaken database annotations
[36; 7]; performing linkage analyses; determining specific
genes involved in biological pathways; identifying genes that
are important at certain times of development (or that are
turned on/off over a course of treatment); elucidating gene
regulatory networks [13]; diagnosing disease in tissue sam Figure

microarray analysis.
In particular
, it is shown in [26] that direct transduction is more effective
than the traditional two step approach of induction
followed by deduction.
Joachims [25] describes
an approximate solver for the semi supervised SVM which
utilizes a fast SVM optimizer as an inner loop.
The story is not all good. [10] tells us that while unlabeled
data may be useful, labeled examples are exponentially more
valuable in a suitable sense. [43] tells us that unlabeled data
may lead the transductive SVM to maximize the wrong margin
, and in [42] it is shown that unlabeled data may in fact
degrade classifier performance under certain conditions relating
the risk and empirical risk.
While Low level Problem 1 involves prediction of continuous
expression levels (non negative real values) given a vector of
(non negative real) perfect match and mismatch intensities,
with total length between 22 and 40, Low level Problem 2 is
a 3 class classification problem with call confidence levels.
