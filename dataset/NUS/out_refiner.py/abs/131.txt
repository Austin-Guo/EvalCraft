Finally we propose a haps scheduler (
ADAPT ) that combines
the previous hops scheduler with a classical guessing
2
Note that this does not imply preemption of tasks which is
not allowed in our setting, but rather the event that a task
hits slower machines that are already overloaded and thus
has to assign itself to a faster machine.
Consequently
ADV uses the following system of capacitated bins so that
these values are preserved:
C
1
=
C
max
,
C
i
=
C
max
r , i = 2, . . . ,
C
total
  C
max
C
max
r
+ 1 (
n)
Observe that the capacity of bin i  2 is r times smaller
than
C
max
, while on the other hand, the cumulative capacity
of the last n   1 machines is
n 1
r
times larger than the
capacity of the largest bin in the system.
Consider also the
following abbreviations of probabilities and events that may
occur upon the arrival of a new ball:
E
i
"bin i is hit by a ball"
P
1
IP[E
1
],  
P
1
1   P

Obviously due to the assumption of a competitiveness,
a  C
total
C
max
= C

+
(
n 1)C
max
r
C

= 1 + n   1
r
since
ALG could choose to assign all the incoming balls to
the largest bin in the system.
Thus,

We have shown that the
oblivious schedulers that perform asymptotically optimally
in the case of identical machines, deteriorate significantly
in this case.

discussions during the write up of the paper and also for
suggesting an appropriate terminology on the categorization
of polling strategies.
