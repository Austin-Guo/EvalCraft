As an illustrative
example of the type of sensor network application that concerns
us here, consider an emergency/disaster scenario where sensors are

The main components of any DCS scheme are: the sensor to
address mapping that gives a logical address to each sensor, and
the event to owner sensor mapping that determines which sensor
will store the event.
Based on the definition of the
weighted split median problem, the algorithm results in forming a
balanced binary tree, such that sensors represent leaf nodes of this
tree (intermediate nodes of the tree are logical nodes, not physical
sensors).
In both cases, we use the balanced binary tree as the base tree
to overlay the attribute specific K D tree on (Recall that a K D tree
is formed by k attributes).
LSR operates in O(log n) rounds.
Thus, s
can compute the least common ancestor (LCA) of s and t in the
K D tree.
To accomplish
this, we apply the weighted split median procedure, where the
weight w
i
associated with sensor i is the number of events stored
at sensor i, and the values are the j'th attributes of the w
i
events
stored at that sensor.
