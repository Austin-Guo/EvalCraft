A complicating factor is that many times a 
administrative process is supported by heterogeneous information 
systems and many different parties can be involved in adapting 
those systems.
The problems facing these organizations in terms of 
measurement and management of perceived quality and of 
satisfaction are more complex than in those organizations where 
only one service is offered, but less complex then situations where 
a service has to be assembled from many other service suppliers.
These measures focus mainly on components visible to users and 
do not take into account back office components like integration.
On the positive side, the report finds that:
E government is developing on schedule.
E government services must be permanently improved: even once 
all government websites are fully functional, government should 
still constantly aim to improve e government and consult target 
groups about new services they might require, says the report.
The yearly research conduct by Accenture [1][2][3] has a 
profound influence on governments.
But even if we would have had a better theory on performance of 
e Government processes and we would have had well funded 
measurement instruments, interpretation of the outcomes of 
applying those instruments would be problematic, especially 
within the political context within these instruments are generally 
used.
Thinking, Systems Practice.
