Correlation coefficient r varies from  1 to 
+1, so that the data distributed near the line biased to (+) 
direction will have positive coefficients, and the data near 
the line biased to ( ) direction will have negative 
coefficients.
Suppose that we have a gene expression pattern g
i
(i = 1 ~
7,129 in Leukemia data, i = 1 ~ 2,000 in Colon data, i = 1 
~ 4,026 in Lymphoma data)
.
General process of classification in 
machine learning is to train classifier to accurately 
recognize patterns from given training samples and to 
classify test samples with the trained classifier.

Fig. 6 shows the comparison of the average performance 
of features.
There are some overlapped genes 
among them as shown in Table .
Moreover, our method of combining classifiers is very 
simple, and there are many methods of combining 
classifiers in machine learning and data mining fields.
