Unary operators
include the Stem operator, which replaces a query term with
its lexem; binary operators include the Boolean operators 
(conjunction),  (disjunction), and   (negation)
1
and the
operator P hrase which requires the adjacency of all terms
in a document.
We are given an oracle that can
be queried with a mapped query m(q)  Q(S) on the size
of subset P (q), oracle(m(q)) = |P (q)|.
Indeed,
when querying the oracle with terms A and B and syntaxes
from S, the disjunction is distinguishable from other operators
by the fact that it constrains bigger subsets in a collection
than any of terms does:
|A  B|  |A|, |A  B|  |B|
(1)
Furthermore, among three other operators, the conjunction
is recognized by its commutativity:
|A  B| = |B  A|
(2)
Finally, the difference between negation and phrases is detected
by the basic equation linking three Boolean operators:
|A  B| = |A B| + |A  B| + |B A|
(3)
Sizes of subsets constrained by the Boolean operators satisfy
the disequation (1) and equations (2), (3) for any pair of
A and B, so one can easily design a learning system that
exactly identifies an unambiguous mapping M after only a
few probing queries.
Three word queries: A AND B , B AND A , A OR
B , B OR A , A NOT B , B NOT A .
Probe queries are obtained from the model queries by replacing
parameters A and B with specific query terms, like
knowledge and retrieval .
To probe the sites with test queries, we bind model queries
in R with query terms.
Considerable research effort has
been devoted to minimizing the possible overheads of query
translation when the meta search and search resource differ
in supporting basic query features [11].
