The historical approach to achieving low cost in 3D graphics systems has been to compromise both performance and image quality .
The challenge is to drive these memory chips at their maximum rate with a minimum of supporting rendering chips , keeping the total system cost and physical size to an absolute minimum .
How this RAM is organized is an important defining feature of any high performance rendering system .
The LeoDraw chips handle all screen space pixel rendering and are directly connected to the frame buffer RAM chips .
Throughput bottlenecks in input geometry format conversion , floating point processing , and pixel rendering were identified and overcome by adding reinforcing hardware to the appropriate chips .
We found users desired algorithms that displayed no roping , angle sensitivities , short vector artifacts , or end point artifacts .
Triangles need single pixel cycle edge walking hardware in parallel with RGBZ span interpolation hardware .
The Triangle Processor and Normal Vector Shader : A VLSI system for High Performance Graphics .
