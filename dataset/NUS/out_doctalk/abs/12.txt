A Geometric Constraint Library for 3D Graphical Applications INTRODUCTION Recent advances in commodity hardware have enabled fast high quality 3D graphics on personal computers .
However , most of such technologies mainly focus on rendering aspects of 3D graphics , and do not sufficiently support layout and behavior aspects .
Also , many specialized 3D graphics packages enable the specification of object layouts and behaviors by using constraints or similar functions .
The novel feature of Chorus3D is to handle scene graphs by processing coordinate transformations in geometric constraint satisfaction .
It determines solutions so that they satisfy as many strong constraints as possible , leaving weaker inconsistent constraints unsatisfied .
For example , it allows putting objects parallel or perpendicular to others without requiring predetermined positioning parameters .
These weights were determined according to the precision of the actual numerical algorithm ( described in the next subsection ) .
