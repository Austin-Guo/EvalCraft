INTRODUCTION Cohesion is one of the most important software features during its development .
The higher the cohesion of a module , the more understandable , modifiable and maintainable the module is .
A software system should have high cohesion and low coupling .
For example , when designing the trigonometric function lib class , we might set a global variable to record the temporal result .
Section 3 discusses the basic definitions and properties for our measure .
Conclusion remarks are given in the last section .
