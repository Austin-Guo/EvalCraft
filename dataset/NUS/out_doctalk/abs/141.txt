INTRODUCTION Routing is a fundamental function in every network that is based on multi hop communications , and wireless sensor networks are no exceptions .
It is not surprising that when having such a vague idea about what to achieve , one can not develop the necessary design principles .
In the former case , the adversary may deploy some corrupted sensor class devices or may capture some honest sensor nodes .
Message deletion may be achieved by employing various selective jamming techniques against either the sender node or the receiver node .
We model the operation of the protocol participants by interactive and probabilistic Turing machines .
3.2 Formalization of a simple attack A simple security objective is to guarantee the correctness of all routing entries in the network .
