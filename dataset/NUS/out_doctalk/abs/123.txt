The first one is relevance feedback which attempts to capture the user 's precise needs through iterative feedback and query refinement .
The automated image annotation methods for CBIR and the high level feature extraction methods in CBVR are all the efforts to model the first mapping .
The second objective of this paper is to provide a practical as well as theoretical guaranteed approach to addressing the problem .
1.3 Organization The structure of this paper is as follows .
PRELIMINARIES Here , we present a sketch introduction to the soft margin SVMs for the convenience of the deduction in Section 4 .
Another obstacle caused by large scale is the increased classification difficulty , that is , the more probable data overlapping .
A possible drawback of this type approach is its high computational costs .
