Machine Learning in DNA Microarray Analysis for Cancer Classification Introduction The need to study whole genome such as Human Genomic Project ( HGP ) is recently increasing because fragmentary knowledge about life phenomenon with complex control functions of molecular level is limited .

Some produce better results than others , but there have been still no comprehensive work to compare the possible feature selection methods and classifiers .
We need a thorough effort to give the evaluation of the possible methods to solve the problems of analyzing gene expression data .
Colon Partial least square Quadratic discriminant analysis 91.9 investigate the genome wide information in short time .
Using the statistical correlation analysis , we can see the linear relationship and the direction of relation between two variables .
But features that have overlapped feature spaces may cause the redundancy of irrelevant information and result in the counter effect such as overfitting .
