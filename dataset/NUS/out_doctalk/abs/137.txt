But it is very natural to expect that in a heterogenous processing environment different machines will have different processing power , and hence different speeds .
This is a desirable feature in many applications because moving jobs across machines may have many overheads .
One of the merits of their algorithm was a much simpler analysis of the competitive ratio .
But converting this idea into a proof requires several technical steps .
PRELIMINARIES We consider the on line problem of minimizing total flow time for related machines .
Let and be suitable chosen large enough constants .
