The tasks arrive sequentially , along with their associated weights ( positive reals ) and have to be assigned immediately and uniquely to the machines of the system .
In case that a random ized scheduler is taken into account , then the cost of the scheduler is the expectation of the corresponding random variable .
125 1.3 Related Work In the case of assigning unit size tasks to identical machines , there has been a lot of intensive research during the last decade .
On the other hand , OBL was inspired by the slowfit approaches for the Related Machines Full Information problem and the fact that a greedy scheduler behaves badly in that case .
CONCLUSIONS In this work we have studied the problem of exploiting limited online information for the assignment of a sequence of unit size tasks to related machines .
As for further research , the issue of providing only limited information to online algorithms is critical in many problems for which an objective is also the minimization of the communication cost .
