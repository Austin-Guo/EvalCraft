This two way derivation lets us connect each of the machines above with an evaluator , and makes it possible to echo variations in the evaluator into variations in the abstract machine , and vice versa .
The abstract machine makes the evaluation steps explicit in a transition system .
8 Some machines operate on terms directly whereas others operate on compiled terms expressed with an instruction set .
The warnings could be avoided with an option type or with an explicit exception , at the price of readability and direct relation to the usual mathematical specifications of abstract machines .
Closure converting expressible and denotable values makes the evaluator first order .
It seems to us that this correspondence between functional evaluators and abstract machines builds a reliable bridge between denotational definitions and definitions of abstract machines .
