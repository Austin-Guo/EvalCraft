The problem studied in this paper is motivated by market share rules , a specific type of rule that can not be represented as association rules .
The results we report in this paper are from real user level Web browsing data provided to us by comScore Networks .

This is an important range to identify if the rules discovered are to be interpreted as suggesting fundamental relationships between the LHS and the market share .
We present detailed experimental results on real web browsing data in Section 6 followed by a literature review and conclusions .
First , it is not limited to mean and variance statistics and assumes a much broader class of statistics , including the market share statistics .
Most conventional approaches in statistics that deals with the multiple hypotheses testing problem use different methods to control FWER by lowering significance level for individual rule , ind .
However , rule discovery on quantitative data faces much more complicated challenges , and conventional p value adjustment methods can not be directly applied .
