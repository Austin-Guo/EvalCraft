In mobile computing , users equipped with mobile devices move in space and register their location at different time instances to spatiotemporal databases via wireless links .
In environmental information systems , tracking animals and weather conditions is very common and large datasets can be created by storing locations of observed objects over time .
Human motion data generated by tracking simultaneously various body joints are also multidimensional trajectories .
So , we would like our similarity model to be robust to noise , support elastic and imprecise matches .
8.1 MBR Generation Comparison The purpose of our first experiment is to test the space consumption of the presented MBR generation methods .
The Library of Congress maintains thousands of handwritten manuscripts , and there is an increasing interest to perform automatic transcribing of these documents .
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we have presented an external memory indexing method for discovering similar multidimensional time series .
The camera mouse : Visual tracking of body features to provide computer access for people with severe disabilities .
