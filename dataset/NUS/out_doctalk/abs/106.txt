Although the definition of the distance depends on applications , its calculation is generally complicated and time consuming .

The former aims at reducing the com putational tasks in the search process by managing objects effectively .
Let P be the set of all objects and B be a subset consisting of selected objects called base prototypes .
There is a trade off between the search efficiency and the size of distance matrix , i.e. the memory capacity .
We propose the use of a multiway tree and the best first order search instead of a binary tree and the depth first search .
During the best first search process , we can traverse preferentially a node whose subset may contain the closest object .
We tested on an artificial set of random points in the 8 dimensional euclidean space .
