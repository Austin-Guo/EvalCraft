The LBS application would interact with 
other location technology components or use the mobile user's 
input to determine the user's location and download the 
information about the restaurants in proximity to the user by 
tuning into the wireless channel which is disseminating LDD.
Tuning time refers to the time 
during which the mobile unit (MU) remains in active state to tune 
the channel and download its required data.

Chen et al. [2] and 
Shivakumar et al. [8] considered unbalanced tree structures to 
optimize energy consumption for non uniform data access.
If these applications are coupled with location information, 
then the search will be fast and highly cost effective.
Also, for a query including range of locations of 
Starbucks, a single query requesting locations for the entire 
region of Kansas City, as shown in Figure 2, will suffice.
As the 
number of internal locations vary for item to item (for example, 
Weather is generally associated with a City whereas traffic is 
granulated up to major and minor roads of a city), we argue that 
the structure of the location mapped information may be 
visualized as a forest which is a collection of general trees, the 
number of general trees depending on the types of information 
broadcasted and depth of a tree depending on the granularity of 
the location information associated with the information.
Figure 8, in contrast, shows us that the tuning time in 
LBIS, though less than the other two schemes, tends to increase 
sharply as the broadcast length becomes greater than the 15000 
pages.
