They match ads to a Web page using
a standard vector model and provide what we may call
trivial solutions.
Let
w
iq
be the weight associated with term t
i
in the query q
and w
ij
be the weight associated with term t
i
in the document
d
j
.
In such schemes,
weights are taken as the product between factors that quantify
the importance of a term in a document (given by the
term frequency, or tf, factor) and its rarity in the whole collection
(given by the inverse document factor, or idf, factor),
see [2] for details.
An advertiser trying to describe a certain topic in a concise
way probably will choose general terms to characterize that
topic.
Table 2 shows top ranked terms that occur in a page covering
Argentinean wines produced using grapes derived from
the Bordeaux region of France.
Terms marked
with `*' are not shared by the sets p and r.
"whites", but also reveal new terms related to the main topic
of the page such as "aroma" and "red".
That is, we might design the system such that its performance
depends fundamentally on the rate that new pages

On the other hand,
in [7] the authors presented an intrusive approach in which
an agent sits between advertisers and the user's browser allowing
a banner to be placed into the currently viewed page.
