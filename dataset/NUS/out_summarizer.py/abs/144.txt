The problem studied in this paper is motivated by market 
share rules, a specific type of rule that cannot be represented as 
association rules.
The 
discovered rules suggest that Expedia seems to be doing 
particularly well among the single households in the North East 
region (rule 2), while it cedes some market in the segment of 
teenagers (rule 4).

Hence 
we can generate datasets in which all transactions represent purchases in 
a single category, and this helps in the generation of market share rules 
representing specific categories.
Although 
these metrics can be generalized to rules where the antecedent and 
consequent are both conjunctions of the form value
1
&lt; Attribute &lt;
value
2
for quantitative datasets, they are not applicable for rules
whose consequent is a function, such as Mean(D
X
), or in general,
f(D
X
).
For quantitative rules in [2], the 
authors use a standard Z test to determine the significance of 
inequality of means between a subset D
X
and its complement D  
D
X
. [33] defines a new measurement, impact, to evaluate
quantitative rules, where impact can identify those groups that 
contribute most to some outcome, such as profits or costs.
Nonparametric methods are widely used on testing models that 
are built from data: as earliest in [18], the author uses 
randomization tests to tackle a model overfitting problem; [20] 
compares bootstrap and cross validation for model accuracy 
estimation; for decision trees, [14, 26] use permutation tests to 
select attributes based on 2
x2 contingency tables.
Traditional methods cannot estimate how many 
rules should be discovered, but with our technique, we can draw 
the conclusion that, there is no rule to be discovered because none 
of the rules is better than chance.
