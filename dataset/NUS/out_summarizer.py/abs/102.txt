Using interactive 3D
graphics, available to more and more people due to recent
advances in consumer graphics hardware, the user may actively
explore the spatial correlations of structures within a
photorealistic virtual model (see upper left of <A href="102.html#1">Figure 1).

Additional
views, whether as insets <A href="102.html#8">[20], separate objects like mirrors
<A href="102.html#8">[8], or in form of lenses and volumetric cursors changing
the rendition of embedded structures <A href="102.html#8">[7, 21, 23], are either
not close enough to the manipulated structures to be fully
recognized without dividing the users attention between
different views <A href="102.html#8">[13] or require sometimes tedious manipulations
to be placed or moved within the scene.
Interactions are
tracked and ranked within an interaction history to
communicate the current interaction context via a client
interface to an external knowledge based component.
.
A simple but effective solution places the annotation
on a semi transparent background face that increases
the contrast between text annotation and illustration and
still does not block vision (see <A href="102.html#4">Figure 5).
The has Part* relation represents the transitive hull over
several spatial part of relations <A href="102.html#7">[1] (e.g. the has Basis relation
between Bones and Bone Volumes and the has Area relation
between Areas or Volumes and Areas).
Nowadays,
this term subsumes breadth first search algorithms for paths
connecting the nodes of a start and a destination set in directed
graphs satisfying an evaluation criterion.
The layer management (see <A href="102.html#6">Figure 8) employs the
OpenGL polygon offset feature to allow graphics to overlap
specifically whereas visibility tests of individual structures
are accomplished by offscreen rendering and analyzing
OpenGL p buffers.
