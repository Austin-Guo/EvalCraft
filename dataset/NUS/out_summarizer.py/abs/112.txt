For
example, the Stanford Daily newspaper has a geographical
scope that consists of the city of Palo Alto (where Stanford
University is located), while the New York Times newspaper
has a geographical scope that includes the entire U.S.
Ding et al. report on
a search engine prototype that simply filters out from the
results for a user query any pages not in the geographical
scope of the user.
Ding et al.
built on the work by Buyukkokten et al. [6], who discussed
how to map a web site (e.g., http://www db.stanford.edu)
to a geographical location (e.g., Palo Alto) and presented a
tool to display the geographical origin of the HTML links
to a given web page.
McCurley
[14] presented a variety of approaches for recognizing
geographical references on web pages, together with a nav igational
tool to browse pages by geographical proximity
and their spatial context.
We obtain these frequencies for both the total count (tokens)
and the unique location words in each page (types), as it is
possible that a few locations would be repeated many times
across the results, indicating a global query, or that many locations
would be repeated few times each, indicating a local
query.
Weiss and Provost
use the C4.5 classifier [17], a decision tree classifier with
additional pruning of nodes to avoid overfitting.
This constraint is meant
to ensure that we are not including in our experimental
data queries that contain misspellings or deal with
extremely esoteric subjects, for which not enough material
for determining locality would be available.
For a given classifier with adjustable parameters, often
precision can be increased at the expense of recall, and vice
versa; therefore we also compute the F measure [20] (with
equal weights) to combine precision and recall into a single
number,
F measure = 2 x Precision x Recall
Precision + Recall
Finally, we argued earlier that one kind of misclassification
errors may be assigned a higher cost.
