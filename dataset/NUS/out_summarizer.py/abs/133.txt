Fig. 1. General process of acquiring the gene expression
data from DNA microarray
DNA microarrays are composed of thousands of 
individual DNA sequences printed in a high density array 
on a glass microscope slide using a robotic arrayer as 
shown in Fig.
Correlation coefficient r varies from  1 to 
+1, so that the data distributed near the line biased to (+) 
direction will have positive coefficients, and the data near 
the line biased to ( ) direction will have negative 
coefficients.
Suppose that we have a gene expression pattern g
i
(i = 1 ~
7,129 in Leukemia data, i = 1 ~ 2,000 in Colon data, i = 1 
~ 4,026 in Lymphoma data)
.
The neural network learns the 
training examples by adjusting the synaptic weight of 
neurons according to the error occurred on the output 
layer.

Fig. 6 shows the comparison of the average performance 
of features.
Moreover, our method of combining classifiers is very 
simple, and there are many methods of combining 
classifiers in machine learning and data mining fields.
