Since more and more applications 
are object oriented, the approaches to measure cohesion of object oriented
(OO) programs have become an important research field.
Generally, each object oriented programming language provides 
facilities to support OO features, such as data abstraction, 
encapsulation and inheritance.
Section 2 
introduces the package in Ada 95.
Typically, a 
package contains the declaration of a type along with the 
declarations of primitive subprograms of the type, which can be 
called from outside the package, while its inner workings remain 
hidden from outside users.
In the package body or a subprogram of the package, 
if the definition (modification) of object A uses (refer, but not 
modify) object B directly or indirectly, or whether A can been 
defined is determined by the state of B, then A depends on B, 
denoted by A B.
Generally, if B is used in the condition part of a control statement 
(such as if and while), and the definition of A is in the inner 
statement of the control statement, the definition of A depends on 
B's state.
In general, the intermediate results are invisible outside, and an 
object might be modified many times in a subprogram.
PGDG consists of three sub graphs:
. Inter Object Dependence Graph (OOG), OOG = &lt;N
O
, E
O
&gt;,
where N
O
is the object node set (the name of a node is the
name of the object it represents); E
O
is the edge set, if
A B, then edge &lt;A, B&gt;
E
O
.
. Inter Subprogram Dependence Graph (PPG), PPG = &lt;N
P
,
E
P
, T&gt;, where N
P
is the subprogram node set; E
P
is the
edge set which represents the dependencies between 
subprograms; T
(V x V) is the tag set, where V is the
union of objects and {*}.
. Subprogram Object Dependence Graph (POG), POG = &lt;N,
E
PO
&gt;, where N is the node set which represents objects
and subprograms; E
PO
is the edge set representing
dependencies between subprograms and objects.
We have two ways to 
measure the package cohesion:
1)  Each measurement works as a field, the package
cohesion is 3 tuple,
Cohesion(PG) = &lt;  Cohesion(O_O, PG),
Cohesion(P_O, PG),  
 Cohesion(P_P, PG)&gt;.
