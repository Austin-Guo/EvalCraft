Typical Web search engines are designed to run short queries
against a huge collection of hyperlinked documents quickly
and cheaply, and are often tuned for the types of queries people
submit most often [2].
Our goal is to have at least 20 million pages that focus on
material for grades 1 through 8.
Annotations are currently stored as Lemur
properties, but later versions will take advantage of the
enhancements planned for support of rich document structure,
described in Section 2.3.
The
text should use both passive  and active voice
sentence constructions and should introduce about
10% new vocabulary relative to the student's
known vocabulary model.
The page's topic is less
important than finding pages that practice the words:
for example, an article on another sport that satisfies
the other constraints would also be acceptable.
Although crude, this captures word frequency
information associated with general reading
difficulty, as well as capturing topics that are the focus of the
curriculum at each grade level.
The
adult studies will provide feedback on vocabulary matching
and comprehension, and the child studies will test the
hypothesis that children will read adaptively to texts that vary
in vocabulary demands, where those texts that closely reflect
the reader's interests and comprehension can be used to
support improved comprehension and vocabulary growth.
The REAP project is intended to advance the state of the art in
information retrieval, as well as research in reading
comprehension, by bringing together practical user models of
student interests, vocabulary knowledge and growth, and other
aspects of reading, with interesting material from large, open
collections like the World Wide Web.
