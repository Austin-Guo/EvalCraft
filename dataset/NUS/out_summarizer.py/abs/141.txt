The natural
question that may arise is why then security of routing
protocols for sensor networks has fallen beyond the scope of
research so far.
Similar to [4], in this paper, we develop an adversary
model that is different from the standard Dolev Yao model,
where the adversary can control all communications in the
system.
We assume that transmitting a message
from the routing sublayer consists of passing the message to
the data link layer, which, after processing the message, also
passes it further to the physical layer.
Here, we must note that most messages
originated from the routing sublayer are composed of only
one frame per message in the data link layer due to performance
reasons, especially when they are used to discover
routing topology.
Upon reception of the frame corresponding
to the message, the adversary can corrupt the frame
check sequence by jamming once the data field of the frame
has been received.
The diversity of routing protocols is caused by these conflicting
requirements: e.g., shortest path routing algorithms
cannot maximize the network lifetime, since always choosing
the same nodes to forward messages causes these nodes to
run out of their energy supply sooner.
Messages on tape out
j
can have the following formats:
  (MSG,
sndr
, cont, e, dest ): MSG message models a
normal broadcast message sent by the adversary
to machine C with sender identifier
sndr
L,
message content cont , energy level e, and identifier
of the intended destination dest
L  {}.
  (JAM, e): Special JAM message, that is sent by
the adversary to machine C, models the jamming
capability of the adversary.
