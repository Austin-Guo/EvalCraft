The experimental
results also show that the optimal number
does not depend on the number of objects.
If the
inequality
d
min
+ r
t
&lt; d(q, p
t
)
(6)
is satisfied, we can see that no object exists in S
t
which is closer to q than p
min
and the traversal to
node t is not necessary.
On

From these viewpoints, the method presented in this
paper is very effective when the distance computations
are time consuming.
