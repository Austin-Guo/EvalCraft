It is anticipated that some interference will
result from all these technologies operating in the same environment
.
In all these cases, the probability
of packet error is computed based on the probability of
packet collision in time and frequency.
An Automatic
Repeat Request (ARQ) procedure is applied to ACL
packets where packets are retransmitted in case of loss until
a positive acknowledgement (ACK) is received at the source.

While one can implement this decoding procedure
by correlating against all 256 possible symbols, we
chose a slightly sub optimal, but considerably faster architecture
similar to the Walsh Hadamard transform; again details
can be found in [15].
Next, we consider the effect of increasing the WLAN
transmission power on the WLAN performance in scenario 2.
From figure 5(c), we observe that even if the WLAN transmission
power is fifty times more than the Bluetooth transmission
power (fixed at 1 mW), the packet loss for the WLAN
does not change.
