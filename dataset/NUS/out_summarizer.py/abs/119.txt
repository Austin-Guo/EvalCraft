The research reported here, though, focuses
solely on such displays' ability to convey information
.
Graphics that encode values  those that change to 
reflect information  in the Web Portal display include 
the weather icon indicating the weather forecast, the 
speedometer icon with a meter indicating the current 
speed of vehicles, and an icon indicating the presence 
of new email messages.
Initially, especially with InfoCanvas, we had concerns
that the introductory tour might not be sufficient 
to allow participants to learn each display.
The newspaper headline question used four 
possible answers containing some similarity (usually 
using the same key words such as "Iraq" or "President 
Bush") to ensure the recall of the headline by context, 
not by recognition of a key word.
Umanath and Scamell showed that 
graphics are conducive towards recall tasks involving 
simple fact retrieval in a series of studies investigating 
the role of recall in real time decision making [18].
The mappings between information and graphical elements
used in this study were designed by the authors, 
and as such, did not always feel instinctive to participants
.
We present results indicating that 
participants comprehended and recalled more awareness
information when it was represented in graphical 
manners; participants recalled more information from 
the InfoCanvas display than the Web Portal and Text based
displays.
