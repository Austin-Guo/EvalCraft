In particular, the authors of [9] develop a distributed algorithm
called Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy
(LEACH) for homogeneous sensor networks where each sensor
elects itself as a cluster head with some probability and

An example of the wireless sensor data gathering networks.
In each round, the cluster heads send
the aggregated data to the mobile base station (e.g., an aircraft
or a satellite) after the cluster heads receive and process the
raw data from the basic sensor node.
In this
paper, our optimization objective is not to minimize the total
energy consumption by all the sensor nodes, but to minimize
the energy consumption of the critical nodes to prolong the
network lifetime.

where
r
n
accounts for the radiated power necessary
to transmit over a distance of
r between source and
destination and
is the energy dissipated in the transmitter
circuit (PLLs, VCOs, etc) which depends on
the digital coding, modulation, etc.
Because the signal
processing component usually consists of complicated
and expensive gear such as Digital Signal Proces sors
(DSP), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA),
etc., the basic sensor nodes do not contain the signal
processing component.
In our model, because the basic sensor nodes in the same
zone will consume almost the same energy in each round
(i.e., sharing the same relaying traffic load when multi hop
communication mode is used), their lifetimes are equal if
their initial energies are the same.
Therefore, if the initial
energy is the same for each basic sensor node, the sensor
nodes which belong to the (arg max

(i, )}) th
zone will cost the most energy and die first which decides the
network lifetime.
