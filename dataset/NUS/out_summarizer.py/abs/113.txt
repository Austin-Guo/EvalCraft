While boundaries are blurred, most online networking
sites share a core of features: through the site an individual
offers a "profile"   a representation of their sel[ves] (and,
often, of their own social networks)   to others to peruse,
with the intention of contacting or being contacted by others
, to meet new friends or dates (Friendster,

Orkut
4
), find
new jobs (LinkedIn
5
), receive or provide recommendations
(Tribe
6
), and much more.
Second, while the number of strong ties that a person
may maintain on a social networking site may not be significantly
increased by online networking technology, Donath
and Boyd note that "the number of weak ties one can
form and maintain may be able to increase substantially,
because the type of communication that can be done more
cheaply and easily with new technology is well suited for
these ties" [9] (p. 80).
We note that information revelation can
work in two ways: by allowing another party to identify a
pseudonymous profile through previous knowledge of a sub ject's
characteristics or traits; or by allowing another party
to infer previously unknown characteristics or traits about a
subject identified on a certain site.
In an interview,
Tribe.net CEO Mark Pincus noted that "[s]ocial networking
has the potential to create an intelligent order in the current
chaos by letting you manage how public you make yourself
and why and who can contact you." [4].

as her birthday.
