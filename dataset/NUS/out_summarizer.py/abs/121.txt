Machine translations
into English for all non English stories were provided
, allowing participants to ignore issues of story translation.
We 
began with the hypothesis that if two stories originated in the 
same language, it would be best to compare them in that language, 
rather than translating them both into another language for comparison
.

These results support the general 
conclusion that when two stories originate in the same language, it 
is better to carry out similarity comparisons in that language, 
rather than translating them into a different language.

Fewer than a third of the topics received adapted stories.
Although we see that the original threshold, .5, was not always the 
optimal value, it is also clear that the pattern we saw at .5 (and in 
Figure 6) does not change as the threshold is varied, that is tracking
with native topic models is not better than tracking with 
global models.
In the previous two sections we showed that when native topic 
models are initialized with language specific training stories that 
are truly on topic, then topic tracking is indeed better with native 
models than with global models.
