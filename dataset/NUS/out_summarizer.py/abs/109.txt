Note that Algorithm 1 is far from being optimal with respect to
runtime performance.
The straightforward recursion scheme does
not take specific actions to prevent unnecessary work and it neither
selects an optimal order for joining sub paths.
Moreover, in the context of semantic web portal
applications the queries are not man entered anymore but rather
generated by a portal's front end (triggered by the user) and often
exceed the size
3
which can be easily computed by using brute
force.
We try to
avoid re inventing the wheel and once again seek for inspiration in
the database field, making it applicable by "relationizing" the RDF
model.
We distinguish between those
sources that can only retrieve the selected local data (pull up strategy
) and those that can perform joins of their local and incoming
external data (push down strategy), thus offering computational services
that could be used to achieve both a higher degree of parallelism
and smaller data transmission over the network, e.g., by applying
semi join reductions [1].
The processing cost of a
hash join of two relations
pY r is defined as rtg
pYr
a s & jpj C
& jrj & f, where jxj denotes the cardinality of the relation x, s
represents the cost of inserting a path instance in the hash table (the
building factor),
models the cost of retrieving a bucket from the
hash table, and
f stands for the average number of path instances
in the bucket.
As we adopted the two phase algorithm our simulations
were able to reproduce the trends in results presented in [17]; due
to the lack of space we omit the detail performance analysis and the
interested reader is referred to the aforementioned survey.
We also do not consider techniques that involve view based query
answering techniques [6] because we are currently not considering
the problem of integrating heterogeneous data.
