of such directories are InvisibleWeb[1] and BrightPlanet[2]
whose gateway site, CompletePlanet[3], is a directory as
well as a meta search engine.
For each database incorporated
into its search, the meta search engine is provided with
a manually written "wrapper", a software component that
specifies how to submit queries and extract query answers
embedded into HTML formatted result pages.
Operators that are actually supported
by an engine may not be mentioned in the help pages, and
conversely, help pages might mention operators that are not
supported by the engine.
New technologies surrounding the XML syntax standard,
in particular Web Services [18], establish a new basis for automatic
discovery and information exchange and are becoming
widely employed in corporate applications.
Instead, the query probing approach
for acquiring supported operators does not assume any cooperation
of Web providers; its only requirement is that they

provide an accessible interface and allow queries to be run.
A
method based on downloading answer documents and verifying
the query against their content often fails, either for legal
reasons, when the content of documents is unavailable or
password protected, or for technical reasons, when a query
matches millions of documents and downloading even a part
of them requires prohibitive time and network resources.
Indeed,
when querying the oracle with terms A and B and syntaxes
from S, the disjunction is distinguishable from other operators
by the fact that it constrains bigger subsets in a collection
than any of terms does:
|A  B|  |A|, |A  B|  |B|
(1)
Furthermore, among three other operators, the conjunction
is recognized by its commutativity:
|A  B| = |B  A|
(2)
Finally, the difference between negation and phrases is detected
by the basic equation linking three Boolean operators:
|A  B| = |A B| + |A  B| + |B A|
(3)
Sizes of subsets constrained by the Boolean operators satisfy
the disequation (1) and equations (2), (3) for any pair of
A and B, so one can easily design a learning system that
exactly identifies an unambiguous mapping M after only a
few probing queries.
Once query language interfaces are understood, meaningful
query transformation becomes possible. [11] describes
one way of transforming a front end query into subsuming
queries that are supported by the sources and a way to filter
out incorrectly returned documents.
