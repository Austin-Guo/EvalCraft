a method to integrate WWW tables according to the
category of objects presented in each table 14].
It is inspired
by the fact that most genuine tables demonstrate certain

but usually not both, while non genuine tables often show
no consistency in either direction.

Three directories
on Google were searched: the business directory and
news directory using key words:
ftable,

figure,

, and the science directory using key words
ftable,

.
Not every genuine table has its title and only 1,308 genuine
tables have table titles.
Our future work includes handling more di erent HTML
styles in pseudo rendering, detecting table titles of the rec ognized
genuine tables and developing a machine learning
based table interpretation algorithm.
