Weber first studied 
modern bureaucracy structures in the 1920s, decades of related 
social scientific researches have been mainly relying on 
questionnaires and interviews to understand individuals' thoughts 
and behaviors for sensing informal networks.
The 
Referral Web project [12] mined a social network from a wide 
variety of publicly available online information, and used it to 
help individuals find experts who could answer their questions 
based on geographical proximity.
In statistical Natural Language processing, one common way
of modeling the contributions of different topics to a document is 
to treat each topic as a probability distribution over words, 
viewing a document as a probability distribution over words, and 
thus viewing a document as a probabilistic mixture over these 
topics.
Hofmann [22] introduced the aspect model Probabilistic
Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA), in which, topics are modeled 
as multinomial distributions over words, and documents are 
assumed to be generated by the activation of multiple topics.
