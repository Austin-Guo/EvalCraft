For example, secure multi party computation
schemes enable two or more parties to compute some
joint function while revealing no information about their respective
inputs except what is leaked by the result of the

For example, a college alumni directory may be obfuscated
in such a way that someone who already knows a person's
name and year of graduation is able to look up that person's
email address, yet spammers cannot indiscriminately
harvest addresses listed in the directory.
Employees of a
credit bureau need to have access to customers' records so
that they can respond to reports of fraudulent transactions,
yet one may want to restrict the bureau's ability to compile
a list of customers' addresses and sell it to a third party.
In our construction
, if the retriever knows the name and date that uniquely
identify a particular record (e.g., because this information
was supplied in a court issued warrant), he (almost) immediately
learns the key that encrypts the purchase details in
the obfuscated record.
This approach, usually in the form of presenting
a puzzle to the adversary and forcing him to solve it, has
been proposed for combating junk email [16], website metering
[17], prevention of TCP SYN flooding attacks [21],
protecting Web protocols [14], and many other applications.
Their definitions aim to capture privacy
of data, while ours aim to make access to the database
indistinguishable from access to a certain ideal functionality.
In this case, for any record in the database, the
share revealed if the retriever supplies the correct value of
X
1
will be exactly the same as the share revealed if the retriever
supplies the value of X
2
.
Note that the order of quantifiers has been changed: the
algorithm A is now independent of the database.
