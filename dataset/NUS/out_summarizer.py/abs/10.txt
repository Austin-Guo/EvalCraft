The results proved again experimentally that a one dimensional
Poisson does not work for rare terms, therefore
Poisson mixtures and additional parameters are proposed.
[3], section 3.3, illustrates and summarises comprehen sively
the relationships between frequencies, probabilities
and Poisson.
We use in our paper a different
notion of noise: we consider a frequency based noise that
corresponds to the document frequency, and we consider a
term noise that is based on the independence of document
events.
[11], [12], [8] and [1] link frequencies and probability estimation
to information theory. [12] establishes a framework
in which information retrieval models are formalised based
on probabilistic inference.
The Pareto distribution compares to the Poisson distribution
in the sense that Pareto is "fat tailed", i. e. Pareto assigns
larger probabilities to large numbers of events than
Poisson distributions do.
The upper bound of the independent noise probability
follows from the limit lim
N
(1 +
x
N
)
N
= e
x
(see
any comprehensive math book, for example, [5], for the convergence
equation of the Euler function).
For a collection with infinite many documents, the upper
bound of the noise probability for terms t
N
that occur in all
documents becomes:
lim
N
P
in
(t

is noisy)
=
lim

By
applying an independence rather a disjointness assumption
, we obtain the probability e
 1
that a term is not noisy
even if the term does occur in all documents.
The
links between indepence based noise as document frequency,
probabilistic interpretation of idf , information theory and
Poisson described in this paper may lead to variable probabilistic
idf and tf definitions and combinations as required
in advanced and personalised information retrieval systems.
