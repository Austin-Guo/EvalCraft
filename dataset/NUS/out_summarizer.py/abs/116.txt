It is assumed the user has already taken digital 
pictures and saved them as files to import into the system, or 
that a camera is set up on the machine running Crayons, so it 
can capture images from it.
The user can then refine the classifier 
by adding more manual classification or, if the classifier is 
satisfactory, the user can export the classifier.
Although the IML and the machine learning component of 
Crayons are the primary discussion of this paper it is notable 
to mention that Crayons has profited from work done by 
Viola and Jones [19] and Jaimes and Chang [5,6,7].
These differences are important; as our 
hypothesis was that faster classifier creation times can 
overcome poorer inductive strength and thus reduce overall 
designer time.
In order to test the amount of time a designer takes to create a 
good classifier, we need a standard to define "good 
classifier".
It is clear from our 
evaluations that a classification algorithm must get under the 
10 20 second barrier in producing a new classification, but 
that once under that barrier, the designer's time begins to 
dominate.
Once the designer's time begins to dominate the 
total time, then the classifier with better generalization wins.
In actuality, 
because of the poor generalization of the mean split 
algorithm, even though the classifier generation time for 
MSSS was quicker than CWSS, the users felt it necessary to 
paint more using the MSSS, so the overall time increased 
using MSSS.
