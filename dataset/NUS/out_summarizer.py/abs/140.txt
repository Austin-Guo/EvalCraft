While extensive work has focused on designing schemes
that can either defend and delay node capture or timely
identify and revoke compromised nodes themselves [5],
little attention has been paid to the node compromise
process itself.
In particular, due to security schemes employed by
the sensor networks, we assume that communication can
only be performed when neighboring nodes can establish
mutual trust by authenticating a common key.
Therefore,
node compromise is not only determined by the deployment
of sensor nodes which in turn affects node density,
but also determined by the pairwise key scheme employed
therein.
Of particular interest is the phase transition of the
spreading process that is dependent on an epidemic threshold
: if the epidemic parameter is above the threshold, the
infection will spread out and become persistent; on the
contrary, if the parameter is below the threshold, the virus
will die out.
A. Network Model as Random Graph
Assume that sensor nodes are uniformly deployed in
a disc area with radius
R. Let  =
N
R
2
denote the node
density of the network where
N is the total number of
the nodes.
We remark that both the analytical and experimental
results have significant implication for security scheme
design in terms of revoking/immunizing compromised
nodes in wireless sensor networks: it dictates the speed at
which the network must react in order to contain/prevent
the effect of network wide epidemic.
The simulation
results for the case without recovery are shown

Furthermore, we introduce the effect of node recovery after
compromise and adapt our model to accommodate this
effect.
