end user difficulty in finding governmental information
(especially statistical data) online, the project seeks to create
an integrated model of user access to US government
statistical information that is rooted in realistic data models
and innovative user interfaces.
The starting point of this work is the notion that access
to information in the BLS website could be improved by
the addition of a dynamic interface such as the relation
browser described by Marchionini and Brunk [13].
Altogether, the link structure of this classificatory
system contains 65 documents; that is, excluding
navigational links, there are 65 documents linked from the
BLS home page, where each hyperlink connects a document
to a topic (pages can be linked to multiple topics).
This metric stemmed
from a desire to suppress the common result where one large
cluster emerges from the k means algorithm, accompanied
by several accordingly small clusters.
Comparing the proportion right and

The ten keyword based clusters
are shown in Table 3, represented by the three terms most
highly associated with each cluster, in terms of the log odds
ratio.
In particular
, the augmented model is significantly inferior to the
model trained solely on Editor's Desk documents if we concern
ourselves only with documents selected by the majority
of human reviewers  i.e. only first choice classes.
Finally, then, in future work we will build
on the user studies undertaken by Marchionini and Brunk
in efforts to evaluate the utility of automatically populated
dynamic interfaces for the users of digital libraries.
