Like some other systems, Leo supports a generalized form of triangle
strip (see Figure 3), where vertex header bits within a strip specify
how the incoming vertex should be combined with previous vertices
to form the next triangle.
Restart corresponds to a "move" operation in
polylines, and allows multiple unconnected variable length triangle
strips to be described by a single data structure passed in by the user,

avoided all this hardware by using more direct control fields,
like horizontal microprogrammable machines, and leaving it to the
assembler (and occasionally the programmer) to skew one logical
instruction across several physical instructions.
Mathematically, each chip thinks it is rasterizing the triangle
into an image memory with valid pixel centers only every five original
pixels horizontally, with each chip starting off biased one more
pixel to the right.
But an examination of the relative
amounts of data flow between rendering pipeline stages shows that
the overall peak data transfer bandwidth demand occurs between
the edge walk and span interpolate sections, induced by long thin
triangles, which commonly occur in tessellated geometry.
Leo's stereo resolution was chosen to support square pixels, so
that lines and antialiased lines are displayed properly in stereo, and
standard window system applications can co exist with stereo.
The
dynamic tessellation technique involves reducing trimmed NURBS
surfaces into properly sized triangles according to a display/pixel
space approximation criteria [1]; i.e. the fineness of tessellation is
view dependent.
