We describe an extension in 2D of the original DTW function
as described by Berndt and Clifford [4].
The LCSS similarity between the envelope of Q and a sequence
A is defined as:
LCSS(M BE
Q
, A) =
n
i=1
1
if A[i] within envelope
0
otherwise
For example, in figure 4 the LCSS similarity between M BE
Q
and sequence A is 46, as indicated in the figure.
A
similar greedy split algorithm is also used for splitting the
MBE of the query trajectory Q.

(a)
Equi Split, 8 MBRs, Gain = 5.992
(b)
Equi Split, 9 MBRs, Gain = 5.004
(c)
Greedy Split, 8MBRs, Gain = 9.157
(d)
Greedy Split, 9MBRs, Gain = 10.595
Figure 7: (a): 8 MBRs produced using equi Split.
The equi split
offers slightly better results, than producing MBRs at random
positions.
We demonstrate the index performance relative to
