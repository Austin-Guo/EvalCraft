Tuzhilin et. al. [23, 22, 29] worked on applying background
knowledge to finding interesting rules.
Even though applying the above definition and sorting
attribute sets on their interestingness works well in practice,
there might still be a large number of patterns retained,
especially if the background knowledge is not well developed
and large number of attribute sets have high interestingness
values.
Notice that topological interestingness is stricter than hierarchical
interestingness.
The problem
has been addressed in literature mainly in the context
of finding marginals for every attribute [25, 15], while here
we have to find marginals for multiple, overlapping sets of
attributes.
The UCI Machine Learning repository contains a
few datasets with background knowledge (Japanese credit,
molecular biology), but they are aimed primarily at Inductive
Logic Programming: the relationships are logical rather
than probabilistic, only relationships involving the class attribute
are included.
All continuous
attributes have been discretized into 3 levels using
the equal weight method.
Indeed, it is known (see [8]) that women's lungs are on average
20%   25% smaller than men's lungs, so sex influences
the forced ejection volume (FEV) much more than smoking
does (which we thought was the primary influence).
This
fact, although not new in general, was overlooked by the
authors, and we suspect that, due to large amount of literature
on harmful effects of smoking, it might have been
overlooked by many domain experts.
