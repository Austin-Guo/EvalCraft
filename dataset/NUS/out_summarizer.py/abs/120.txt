As an illustrative
example of the type of sensor network application that concerns
us here, consider an emergency/disaster scenario where sensors are

Certainly, it is not desirable to have a storage scheme whose
performance and QoD guarantees rest on the assumption that the
sensors are uniformly distributed geographically.
In both cases, we use the balanced binary tree as the base tree
to overlay the attribute specific K D tree on (Recall that a K D tree
is formed by k attributes).

figure is that the total number of movements is not highly dependent
on the hot spot size.
However, this approach may be more appropriate
to answer continuous queries, which are queries running
on servers and mostly processing events generated by all the sensor
nodes over a large period of time [4, 10, 18, 14, 12, 11].
The mapping was done using hash
tables in DHT [15] and GHT [13], or using K D trees in DIM [9].
Sensor databases are becoming embedded in every aspect of our
life from merchandise tracking, healthcare, to disaster responds.
