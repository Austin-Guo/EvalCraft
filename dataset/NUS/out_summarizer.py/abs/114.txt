Interestingly, in most cases, the visual
presentation clearly marks noisy links which surfers rarely
follow, but macroscopic algorithms are unable to exploit it.
Google combines link based ranking
with page text and anchor text in undisclosed ways, and
keeps tweaking the combination, but suffers an occasional
embarrassment

Distillation has always been observed to work well for
"broad" topics (for which there exist well connected relevant
Web subgraphs and "pure" hubs) and not too well for
"narrow" topics, because w.r.t. narrow topics most hubs are
mixed and have too many irrelevant links.
Links that connected pages on the
same Web server (based on canonical host name match) were
dropped from consideration because they were often seen to
serve only a navigational purpose, or were "nepotistic" in
nature.
Our
work establishes the value of a bipartite model like HITS,
and indeed, the value of an asymmetric model where hubs

Figure 3: (a) HITS, a macroscopic topic distillation algorithm
with uniform edge weights; (b) The B&H algorithm, apart from
using non uniform edge weights, discards pages in the expanded
set which are too dissimilar to the rootset pages to prevent topic
drift.
Even though our experiments were performed on a 700
MHz Pentium Xeon processor with 512 MB RAM and 60 GB
of disk, handling this scale of operation required some care
and compromise.

affirmative action is not very popular, but adjoining DOM
subtrees (upper right corner) create a dense network of software
sites and mislead macroscopic distillation algorithms.
We propose a new
technique for aggregating and propagating micro hub scores
at a level determined by the Minimum Description Length
principle applied to the DOMtree with hub scores at the
leaves.
