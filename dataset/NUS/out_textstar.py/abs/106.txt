For the NN and k NN searches in metric spaces,
some methods that can manage a large set of objects
efficiently have been introduced(Hjaltason &
Samet 2003).
They are categorized into two groups.
The pivot p
r
of the right child node
is set to p
t
.
S
t
is partitioned into S
r
and S
l
by Eq.
These operations are recursively repeated until
|S
t
| = 1.
Since g
p
t
d(q, p
t
), Eq.
If our method misses a and give a as
the answer, the equation
g(q, a)   .
