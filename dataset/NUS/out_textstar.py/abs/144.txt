This is the case since for a given rule the interval is 
generated by sampling sup
D
records many times and if another
rule has support = sup
D
then the interval for that rule will be
similar if the same procedure is repeated (it will not be exactly the

N
perm
is typically a big number.
If we let N
perm
= N!, which is the number
of all possible permutations, we will be implementing a Monte Carlo 
test.
For a statistic like 
market share whose value is limited by 0 and 1, N
perm
&gt; 1000 makes the
distribution precise to the third decimal place.
Our significance test is different from the above primarily 
because (i) our significance definition is applicable to any user defined
aggregate function f(D
X
), and (ii) we using nonparametric
methods to construct distributions and confidence intervals, in 
which f(D
X
) is expected from random effects alone.
