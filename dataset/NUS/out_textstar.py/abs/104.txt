While the textbook provides a 
reasonable coverage of some of the subtopics discussed, it does 
not sufficiently stress the importance of the users and the 
importance of HCI in systems development, and we, therefore, 
emphasize this issue throughout the course.
We discussed the way 
in which we cover these topics in Points 2 and 3 in section 3.3.
Whether this is best provided in the 
form of a textbook, or, more dynamically, as a set of online 
learning objects ([1], [2]) is a question open to debate.
