This means one has to search for 
ER unit of index in the major index.
We can see that the tuning time tends to become stable as the 
length of broadcast increases.
In figure 6 we consider m= 4.
Here 
we can see that the exponential and the distributed perform almost 
similarly, though the former seems to perform slightly better as 
the broadcast length increases.
