None
of them performs clustering in the feature space, though the
SVMs works in the feature space.
In Fig.
The data are generated by

=
{(x, y)|y =sin(x) +0.7x[rand(0, 1) 1], x  [0, ]}
D
=
{(x, y)|y =  sin(x)+1+0.7xrand(0, 1), x  [0, ]},
where rand(0, 1) generates the random numbers uniformly
distributed between 0 and 1, and  is a parameter controlling
the overlapping ratio of the two classes.
