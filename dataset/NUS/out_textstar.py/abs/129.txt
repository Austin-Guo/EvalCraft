A bootstrap sample of the data is a
sample with replacement, so that X
m
= (x
m
1
, .
, n} with
repetitions allowed.
To be more specific, a decision tree typically operates with a
multinomial likelihood,
leaves
j
classes
k
p
n
jk
jk
,
where p
jk
is the true probability that an observation in leaf j will be in class k, and n
jk
is
the count of data points in leaf j in class k. This is easily re written as the product over
all observations,
n
i
=1
p

i
where if observation i is in leaf j and a member of class k then
p

i
= p
jk
.
For simplicity, we consider the case k = 2 as the generalization to larger k is
straightforward.
Now consider a single point, y, which takes values 0 or 1 depending on
which class is it a member of.
It can also lead to increased accuracy and decreased prediction variance for smaller data
sets.
