Actually, to keep things simple, we shall assume throughout
the paper that ~
y is empty, thereby dealing with universally
quantified constraints.
We assume that
queries over
RS = ,  are Unions of Conjunctive Queries
(UCQs), i.e., formulas of the form
{~x | ~y
1
.
Indeed, we can guess in NP a source instance
D, build in polynomial time a model B for P w.r.t.
Actually, we can do much better.
