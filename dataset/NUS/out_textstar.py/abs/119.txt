systems in promoting greater flexibility of information 
monitored and its subsequent visual representation, as 
well as allowing for greater user control in specifying 
those mappings.
Although many types of displays exist and new ones
are being developed, little is known about what makes a 
particular peripheral/ambient display more successful at 
presenting information than another [10].
Pilot testing, 
however, revealed that participants were able to quickly 
learn the information mappings.
To further ensure that 
we would be testing information comprehension and 
recall but not mapping recall with respect to the InfoCanvas
, participants were asked to point out the different
objects on a sample display and say aloud what information
each object represented.
Therefore, 
we speculate that if individuals create their own mappings
, leveraging their personal experiences, recall with 
InfoCanvas will benefit even more.
This study examined the information conveyance 
abilities of three specific examples of displays involving
a sample population consisting mainly of academic related
, relatively young individuals.
Generalizing its 
findings too much would be unwise.
Nevertheless, we 
speculate that the results would extend to other similar 
types of displays and people of different demographics.
