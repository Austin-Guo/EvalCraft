Also note that the probability of loss for the 30% WLAN of 208
GOLMIE ET AL.
However, this difference is statistically insignificant.
At the 1 Mbit/s
rate, WLAN packets of the same bit lengths take considerably

more pronounced.
For a further discussion of the 1 Mbit/s
case, please see [7].
The first one has the WLAN
device, in the midst of the Bluetooth piconets, acting at the
source, while the second one has the WLAN access point acting
as the source.
Topology 2
We first look at the topology illustrated in figure 8.
