(12), we can simplify the objective
function as "min
{E
max
}" and remove the constraint given
by Eq.
(22) by letting
E
init2
= E
0
.
So far, given the communication range (
R), we obtain the
minimum
E
max
(

) for the basic sensor nodes in order to
derive the solutions for objective function of Eq.
(24) as
follows:
E
max
(

) = [R
n
(1 +

X
n

) +  + ]l
(29)
Next, we want to identify the optimal
R

to minimize
E
max
(

) when constraint given by Eq.
(20) applies.
