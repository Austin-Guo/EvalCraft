This we will see later is requierd to ensure that the
intervals do not overlap too much.
Proof.
Recall that J
q+1
(k, l) is the set of jobs in J(k, l)
which get released before t
q
b
.
However some of these jobs
may get dispatched after t
q
b
and hence I
q
and I
q+1
can intersect
.
Consider some job j  J
q+1
(k, l) which is dispatched during
I
q
.
