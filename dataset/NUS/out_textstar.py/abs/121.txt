The present research is an exploration of the native language hypothesis
for multilingual topic tracking.
We first present results on 
story link detection, to support the native language hypothesis in a 
simple, understandable task.
Then we present experiments that 
test the hypothesis in the topic tracking task.

Although we see that the original threshold, .5, was not always the 
optimal value, it is also clear that the pattern we saw at .5 (and in 
Figure 6) does not change as the threshold is varied, that is tracking
with native topic models is not better than tracking with 
global models.
