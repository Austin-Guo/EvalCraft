the present invention provides such a spherical block structure wherein each spherical block is made up of three intersecting rings corresponding to the three axes of the sphere . each ring comprises eight subunits with two of those subunits being shared with each of the other two rings . the spherical block structure created by the intersecting rings results in a hollow center with eight cavities radiating outward , the cavities providing a location for the disposition of a connection means whereby individual spherical blocks may be releasably connected to form larger structures .
