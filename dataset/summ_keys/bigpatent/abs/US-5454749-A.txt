a grinding method is provided which is capable of uniformly and precisely grinding objects for a short time , softening shocks produced when the rotation of a grinding barrel is changed between the forward direction and the backward direction to thereby eliminate bruises on the surface of grounded objects , coping with grinding for a large number of objects to be ground in a small quantity or a heavy - weight or a large - size object to be ground , and preventing contacts and collisions between objects to be ground . the grinding method comprises the steps of rotatably mounting not less than one grinding barrels at locations away from the central axis of a rotary drum , enclosing a grinding material and objects to be ground in the grinding barrels , rotating the grinding barrels in the directions identical to and opposite to the direction in which the rotary drum is rotated , and grinding the objects to be ground . an grinding apparatus for implementing the above - mentioned method is also provided .
