a method for manufacturing cigarette filters which have a well - stabilized shape in which acetate fibrous tows impregnated with carboxylic acid ester of polyol are formed into a predetermined shape , uniformly impregnated with water , and irradiated with microwave energy . water is used during the application of microwave energy to enhance the absorption of microwave energy and hence heating of the filter . this causes the carboxylic acid ester of polyol to very rapidly disperse causing it to permeate into the acetate fiber to rapidly complete the stabilization and solidification of the filter .
