in a method and an apparatus for affecting the cornering performance of a motor vehicle , a transverse acceleration of the motor vehicle is determined , a desired transverse tilt of the motor vehicle defined based on the determined transverse acceleration , at least one actuator of an active suspension system of the motor vehicle is adjusted so that the motor vehicle assumes the desired transverse tilt , and an additional actuator intervening in the steering system of the motor vehicle . a yaw movement of the motor vehicle caused by the adjustment of the at least one actuator of the active suspension system is at least partially compensated by the additional actuator .
