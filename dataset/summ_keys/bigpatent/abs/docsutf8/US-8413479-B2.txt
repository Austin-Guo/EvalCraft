a forging die tool set defines a cavity and includes a core rod in the cavity for shaping a void in a work piece . the core rod extends in a direction in which the work piece is introduced , compressed , and ejected from the cavity . the core rod includes an upper portion and a lower portion . the upper portion has a cross sectional shape that forms a certain shape in the work piece and a radially tapered section that tapers toward the lower portion of the core rod . the lower portion also has a cross sectional shape that forms a certain shape in the work piece , and the cross sectional shape of the upper portion differs from the cross sectional shape of the lower portion , the lower portion being a more wear resistant shape characterized by larger radii and the upper portion being a finishing shape with smaller radii for shaping the final form of the forged work piece .
