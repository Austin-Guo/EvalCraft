the invention relates to a method and an arrangement for the continuous heat treatment and packaging of a liquid product with the object of sterilizing the product , the product being heated for a short time together with , and surrounded by , the packing material wherein it is to be enclosed . the product is introduced into a tube of flexible material whereupon the tube containing the product is introduced between two parallel metal bands , movably synchronously in their longitudinal direction , the tube being received and compressed between the bands so that the tube is transported with the bands at the same time as the cross - sectional area of the tube is reduced and the product is made to flow forward through the compressed tube in a gaplike space . heat is transmitted to the product with the help of the metal bands while the product present between the metal bands is kept under pressure . after the heating required for sterilization , the product is cooled and while it is still in the tube , is made to emerge and be freed from the metal bands , whereupon the tube and the product are divided into individual packing units through repeated transverse sealing of the tube .
