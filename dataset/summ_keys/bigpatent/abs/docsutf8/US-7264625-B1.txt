a surgical clip applier for use in closing wounds under the microscope in small blood vessels modifies a well - known clip applier system to make more steady and reliable the application of very small clips during surgery on a scale of vessel size of 2 mm in external diameter and smaller . the known device is modified internally so as to be capable of receiving a flexible remote actuation device which can be a cable release such as used for a camera shutter , or which can be a flexible hydraulic or pneumatic line as a force - transmitting device . thus , the surgeon can hold the clip applier very steadily at the site desired without contracting any intrinsic muscles while the cable release is depressed by another person , or with the surgeon &# 39 ; s other hand , or with a foot pedal .
