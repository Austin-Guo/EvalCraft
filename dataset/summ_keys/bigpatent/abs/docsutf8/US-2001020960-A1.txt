the present invention provides an ink - jet printer having high resolution and image quality , low power consumption , low cost and containing line heads . the ink - jet printer emits droplets of ink arriving as ink dots forming images and letters recorded onto a recording medium from a line head having a plurality of nozzles arrayed in the width direction of the recording medium which is almost perpendicular to the feed direction of the recording medium , and the printer comprises head chips having a specified number of nozzles and a drive circuit to drive each nozzle , in which a plurality of the head chips are arrayed in the width direction thereof to form the line head so that the nozzles each head chip has and part of the nozzles the neighboring head chips have are arrayed in the feed direction of the recording medium , the nozzles each head chip has are sequentially time - series driven by separate driving , and the number of the nozzles each head chip has is the number of part of the nozzles the neighboring head chips have and the number of nozzles arrayed in the feed direction of the recording medium added to the integer multiple of the number of phases for the separate driving of the nozzles .
