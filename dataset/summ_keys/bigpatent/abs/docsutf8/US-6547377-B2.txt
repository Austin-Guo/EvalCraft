techniques for air management in an inkjet printing systems . a method includes providing an ink supply for holding a supply of liquid ink , the ink supply including high barriers to air diffusion , filling the ink supply with a quantity of liquid unsaturated ink , storing the filled ink supply for a storage time interval or until needed , installing the ink supply in an inkjet printing system including an inkjet printhead , supplying unsaturated ink from the ink supply to the inkjet printhead for printing , and allowing the unsaturated ink to absorb air introduced into the printing system , and ejecting droplets of the liquid ink from the printing system during the printing . a semipermanent inkjet printhead for the inkjet printing system includes a printhead body with an internal plenum , a pressure regulator for regulating pressure in the plenum , a nozzle array for ejecting droplets of ink , a fluid inlet mounted to the printhead body and coupled to the plenum for connection to an ink supply path for ink delivered from a replaceable ink supply , and a supply of unsaturated ink disposed in the plenum , the unsaturated ink having an air solubility level sufficient to absorb air introduced into the printhead .
