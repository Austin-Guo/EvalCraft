an vacuum bag for forming of a fiber reinforced composite article , made of a curable elastomer , having molded in resin distribution means . optional vacuum conduits are molded into the periphery of the bag , causing the bag to be adapted to any number of mold shapes . the bag contains a resin distribution conduit sealed into the vacuum bag . a multiplicity of cross channels are formed on the inner surface of the bag , covering most of the area under which the fiber lay up is placed within the mold . these cross channels can be formed from a pattern of multiple , variegated small dots or pentagons , which , under vacuum , leave a multiplicity of small crisscross channels running along the inner surface of the vacuum bag . this pattern of distribution channels covers most of the fiber lay up , except for a perimeter area which insures resin flow into rather than across the fiber lay up .
