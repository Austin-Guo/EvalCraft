a multi - spindle fiber pay - out apparatus is provided that allows for fiber tension control . a frame supports a plurality of spools of fiber , with each spool of fiber being mounted on a spindle . the spindle is in rotational supporting relation to the spool of fiber and is operatively engaged with a magnetic particle brake , which is itself in control communication with an electronic controller . a fiber take - up system is mounted upon the frame in cooperative relation to the spool of fiber and is arranged so as to compensate for changes in the fiber - pay - out rate from the spool of fiber that are caused by activation / deactivation of the magnetic particle brake . a load cell transducer is mounted on the frame adjacent to the fiber take - up system . the load cell transducer is at least partially engaged by a fiber , and is arranged in electrical data communication with the magnetic particle brake so as to activate the magnetic particle brake when a tension in the fiber is detected below a predetermined magnitude , and deactivate the magnetic particle brake when the tension in the fiber is at or above the predetermined magnitude . a method is also provided for monitoring and adjusting the length of a fiber via monitoring of the tension in the fiber .
