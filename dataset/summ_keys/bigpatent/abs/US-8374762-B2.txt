a travel speed limiting apparatus including : a travel speed measurement device which measures a travel speed of a vehicle ; a speed limit memory device which stores a speed limit set by an operator ; a first driving force limit value calculation device which calculates a first driving force limit value based on a deviation of the travel speed from the speed limit ; a requested driving force calculation device which calculates a requested driving force based on an operator &# 39 ; s acceleration operation ; and a second driving force limit value calculation device which calculates a second driving force limit value based on the requested driving force , wherein the driving force limiting device sets an eventual driving force limit value to the smaller of the first driving force limit value and the second driving force limit value , and controls the driving force of the vehicle to be less than the eventual driving force limit value .
