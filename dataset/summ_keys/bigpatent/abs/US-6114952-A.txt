a remote fault indicating unit for an electronic system , such as a vehicle adaptive braking system , includes a series of visual indicators , such as light emitting diodes , on one surface of the housing and a computer serial port connector for use when troubleshooting is done with a pc equipped with the appropriate software . each of the indicators is activated in response to a predetermined malfunction sensed in the system , such as a defective speed sensor , defective modulator , or a defect in the electronic circuitry . the indicators are reset with a switch when the system is repaired . when the reset switch is activated , all of the indicators flash on and are then turned off . the reset switch can also be activated for a longer period of time changing the ecu configuration . a non - volatile ram stores , in the abs ecu , suspected problems sensed by the antilock system when the system is powered down , so that all malfunctions are again indicated immediately when the abs is powered up .
