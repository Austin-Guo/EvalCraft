although the following detailed description contains many specific details for purposes of illustration , one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that many variations and alterations to the following details are within the scope and spirit of the invention . accordingly , any exemplary embodiments of the invention described herein are set forth without any loss of generality to , and without imposing limitations thereon , the present invention . alcohols are generally classified into primary , secondary and tertiary , based upon the number of carbon atoms connected to the carbon atom that bears the hydroxyl group . namely , the primary alcohols have general formulas rch 2 — oh ; secondary alcohols are rr ′ ch — oh ; and tertiary alcohols are rr ′ r ″ c — oh , where r , r ′ and r ″ stand for alkyl groups . ethanol and n   propyl alcohol are primary alcohols , and isopropyl alcohol is a secondary alcohol . in a typical dehydrogenation reaction of alcohol , the alcohol combines with heat in the presence of a suitable catalyst to yield hydrogen gas and either a ketone or an aldehyde . the generic dehydrogenation reaction of an alcohol is expressed below : primary alcohols ( r — ch 2 — oh ) are dehydrogenized to aldehydes ( r — cho ), whereas secondary alcohols ( rr ′ ch — oh ) are dehydrogenized to ketones ( rr ′ c — oh ). in a preferred embodiment , isopropanol (“ ipa ”) can be dehydrogenized to form acetone and hydrogen according to the following reaction : in this reaction , ipa is heated from room temperature to a reaction temperature . when the ipa reaches this temperature and is in the presence of an acceptable catalyst , the ipa converts to acetone and hydrogen while also absorbing energy , thereby lowering the temperature . additional heat can be absorbed by vaporizing the acetone and any unreacted ipa . exemplary catalyst include , for example , an activated metal of rhodium or ruthenium on a support of alumina or activated carbon . preferred catalyst include ruthenium on carbon and rhodium on alumina , with rhodium on alumina being most preferred . in one embodiment , a synthesized ruthenium catalyst can be prepared by making an aqueous solution of ruthenium chloride , adding the solution to activated carbon , and then adding sodium borohydride . a 5 % metal to total mass of the catalyst is preferred . in various embodiments of the present invention , the catalyst can be placed inside a heat exchanger , a separate reaction zone , or added with the alcohol at various points within the apparatus . the advantage of using of ipa , as opposed to using jet fuel as described in the background , can be seen in table i below : generally speaking , ipa provides an additional heat sink capability of approximately 40 % over jet fuel even without any conversion . furthermore , with every 2 % conversion of ipa , an additional 40 j / g of heat can be absorbed . however , the dehydrogenation of ipa is equilibrium limited . therefore , removal of the reaction products from reaction zone can greatly increase the efficiency of the overall reaction , leading to additional removal of heat . now referring to fig1 , catalytic alcohol dehydrogenation heat sink (“ cadhs ”) may be used to absorb or transfer heat from various heat sources . cadhs may be used , for example , to reduce heat in a vehicle such as an aircraft or an automobile . exemplary aircraft include airplanes , jets , helicopters , space shuttles , and rockets . furthermore , cadhs may be used in any other equipment requiring a heat sink . sources of heat on an aircraft may include , for example , electronics , and the like . electronics can include avionics or any other electrical or electronic equipment located on an aircraft . the cadhs can include first vessel [ 10 ], which contains alcohol , and second vessel [ 20 ], which contains fuel . the cadhs also can include heat source [ 30 ], reaction zone [ 40 ], and burner [ 50 ]. first vessel [ 10 ] is in fluid communication with reaction zone [ 40 ] via line [ 12 ] and second vessel [ 20 ] is in fluid communication with burner [ 50 ] via line [ 22 ]. second vessel [ 20 ] contains fuel that is sent to burner [ 50 ] for use as a primary fuel . the cadhs can optionally include separator [ 60 ]. in one embodiment , heat source [ 30 ] includes electrical equipment located on the vehicle . in an aircraft this would include , for example , avionics ; communications , navigation and monitoring hardware ; collision   avoidance systems ; weather systems and radar ; electro   optics ; electronic support measures and defensive aids systems and the like . when the vehicle is operational , the electrical equipment within heat source [ 30 ] produces heat . at certain temperatures , the electrical equipment can become damaged . in an embodiment of the present invention , heat source [ 30 ] is in thermal communication [ 32 ] with reaction zone [ 40 ] such that heat energy is transferred from heat source [ 30 ] to reaction zone [ 40 ]. this advantageously lowers the temperature within heat source [ 30 ], while also increasing the temperature within reaction zone [ 40 ] in order to enable a catalytic dehydrogenation reaction when alcohol from first vessel [ 10 ] is fed into reaction zone [ 40 ] in the presence of a catalyst . this reaction is an endothermic reaction , thereby reducing the temperature within reaction zone [ 40 ] and allowing additional heat energy to be transferred from heat source [ 30 ]. the endothermic reaction creates a reaction fluid that includes hydrogen and either an aldehyde or a ketone . the reaction fluid can also include unreacted alcohol . this reaction fluid can then be sent to burner [ 50 ] via line [ 42 ] to be burned and used as a supplementary fuel . in an optional embodiment , at least a portion of the reaction fluid can be sent to separator [ 60 ] via line [ 44 ]. at least a portion of the unreacted alcohol can be separated from the reaction fluid and recycled to first vessel [ 10 ] via line [ 64 ] or reintroduced directly to reaction zone [ 40 ] via line [ 66 ]. the remaining components of the reaction fluid can then be sent to burner [ 50 ] via line [ 62 ] to be used as a supplementary fuel . in an additional embodiment not shown , separator [ 60 ] can separate the reaction fluid into three separate component streams , sending the hydrogen to burner [ 50 ], sending unreacted alcohol to first vessel [ 10 ] or reaction zone [ 40 ], and vaporizing the aldehyde / ketone in order to absorb additional heat energy from heat source [ 30 ]. vaporization can be accomplished by absorption of additional heat energy from heat source such that the temperature rises above the respective boiling point . additionally , in embodiments in which the cadhs is operating under increased pressures , vaporization can also be accomplished by reducing the pressure of the system . referring to fig2 , a thermal fluid is contained within third vessel [ 15 ]. the thermal fluid is used to absorb heat from heat source [ 30 ] via line [ 17 ]. the heated thermal fluid then passes through the hot side of heat exchanger [ 25 ] and transfers its heat energy to the alcohol from first vessel [ 10 ] that enters the cold side of heat exchanger [ 25 ] via line [ 12 ]. the alcohol is now heated to a temperature that enables an endothermic reaction , such that once the alcohol is introduced to reaction zone [ 40 ] in the presence of the suitable catalyst , the alcohol undergoes an endothermic dehydrogenation reaction . while fig2 shows an embodiment in which heat exchanger [ 25 ] and reaction zone [ 40 ] are separate units , reaction zone [ 40 ] and heat exchanger [ 25 ] can be combined into one unit . the endothermic reaction creates a reaction fluid that includes hydrogen and either an aldehyde or a ketone . the reaction fluid can also include unreacted alcohol . this reaction fluid can then be sent to burner [ 50 ] via line [ 42 ] to be burned and used as a supplementary fuel . in an optional embodiment , at least a portion of the reaction fluid can be sent to separator [ 60 ] via line [ 44 ]. at least a portion of the unreacted alcohol can be separated from the reaction fluid and recycled to first vessel [ 10 ] via line [ 64 ] or reintroduced directly to reaction zone [ 40 ] via line [ 66 ]. the remaining components of the reaction fluid can then be sent to burner [ 50 ] via line [ 62 ] to be used as a supplementary fuel . in an additional embodiment not shown , separator [ 60 ] can separate the reaction fluid into three separate component streams , sending the hydrogen to burner [ 50 ], sending unreacted alcohol to first vessel [ 10 ] or reaction zone [ 40 ], and vaporizing the aldehyde / ketone in order to absorb additional heat energy from heat source [ 30 ]. vaporization can be accomplished by absorption of additional heat energy from heat source such that the temperature rises above the respective boiling point . additionally , in embodiments in which the cadhs is operating under increased pressures , vaporization can also be accomplished by reducing the pressure of the system . fig3 represents a simplified cadhs system in which fuel from second vessel [ 20 ] is used as the thermal fluid . in this embodiment , the fuel is used to transfer the heat energy from heat source [ 30 ] to the alcohol before the fuel is sent to burner [ 50 ]. additionally , a portion of the fuel may be recycled back to second vessel [ 20 ] via line [ 23 ]. while fig3 does not show separator [ 60 ], those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that separator [ 60 ] could be easily incorporated into the design . additionally , like fig2 , reaction zone [ 40 ] and heat exchanger [ 25 ] can be combined into one unit . as will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art , the present invention may easily be produced in other specific forms without departing from its spirit or essential characteristics . the presented embodiments are , therefore , to be considered as merely illustrative and not restrictive , the scope of the invention being indicated by the claims rather than the foregoing description , and all changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalence of the claims are therefore intended to be embraced therein . the present invention may suitably comprise , consist or consist essentially of the elements disclosed and may be practiced in the absence of an element not disclosed .
