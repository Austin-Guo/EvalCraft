a printhead is provided having an elongate support having a plurality of internal webs protruding from a base section to define a plurality of parallel fluid supply channels , a shim supported by the support and defining a plurality of rows of openings through which fluid from respective supply channels is supplied , and a plurality of elongate printhead modules supported serially on the shim . each module defines a plurality of fluid supply passages through which fluid passes to fluid ejection nozzles from respective rows of the openings . either end of each module defines complementary formations such that adjacent modules nest together .
fig1 shows in perspective view an inkjet printhead assembly 1 according to one aspect of the invention and , in phantom outline , a surface 2 on which printing is to be effected . in use , the surface 2 moves relative to the assembly 1 in a direction indicated by arrow 3 and transverse to the main extension of assembly 1 ( this direction is hereinafter also referred to as the transverse direction of the assembly 1 ), so that elongate printhead segments 4 , in particular memjet printhead segments such as described in the above   mentioned pct / au98 / 00550 , placed in stepped overlapping sequence along the lengthwise extension of assembly 1 can print simultaneously across substantially the entire width of the surface . the assembly 1 includes a shield plate 5 with which the surface 2 may come into sliding contact during such printing . shield plate 5 has slots 6 , each corresponding to one of the printhead segments 4 , and through which ink ejected by that printhead segment 4 can reach surface 2 . the particular assembly 1 shown in fig1 has eleven printhead segments 4 , each capable of printing along a 2 cm printing length ( or , in other words , within a printing range extending 2 cm ) in a direction parallel to arrow 7 ( hereinafter also called the lengthwise direction of the assembly 1 ) and is suitable for single   pass printing of a portrait a4   letter size page . however , this number of printhead segments 4 and their length are in no way limiting , the invention being applicable to printhead assemblies of varying lengths and incorporating other required numbers of printhead segments 4 . the slots 6 and the printhead segments 4 are arranged along two parallel lines in the lengthwise direction , with the printing length of each segment 4 ( other than the endmost segments 4 ) slightly overlapping that of its two neighboring segments 4 in the other line . the printing length of each of the two endmost segments 4 overlaps the printing length of its nearest neighbour in the other row at one end only . thus printing across the surface 2 is possible without gaps in the lengthwise direction of the assembly . in the particular assembly shown , the overlap is approximately 1 mm at each end of the 2 cm printing length , but this figure is by no means limiting . fig2 shows assembly 1 with the shield plate 5 removed . each printhead segment 4 is secured to an associated one printhead segment carrier 8 that will be described below in more detail . also secured to each printhead segment 4 is a tape automated bonded ( tab ) film 9 which carries signal and power connections ( not individually shown ) to the associated printhead segment 4 . each tab film 9 is closely wrapped around an extruded support profile 10 ( whose function will be explained below ) that houses and supports carriers 8 , and they each terminate onto a printed circuit board ( pcb ) 11 secured to the profile 10 on a side thereof opposite to that where the printhead segments 4 are mounted , see also fig3 . fig3 shows an exploded perspective view of a part only of assembly 1 . in this view , three only of the printhead segment carriers 8 are shown numbered 8 a , 8 b and 8 c , and only the printhead segment 4 associated with printhead segment carrier 8 a is shown and numbered 4 a . the tab film 9 associated therewith is terminated at one end on an outer face of the printhead segment 4 and is otherwise shown ( for clarity purposes ) in the unwound , flat state it has before being wound around profile 10 and connected to pcb 11 . as can be seen in fig3 , printhead segment carriers 8 are received ( and secured ), together with an interposed sealing shim 25 , in a slot 21 of half   circular cross   sectional shape in profile member 10 as will be explained in more detail below . fig4 illustrates a cross   section of the profile member 10 ( which is preferably an aluminium alloy extrusion ). this component serves as a frame and / or support structure for the printhead segment carriers 8 ( with their associated printhead segments 4 and tab films 9 ), the pcb 11 and shield plate 5 . it also serves as an integral ink supply arrangement for the printhead segments 4 , as will become clearer later . profile member 10 is of semi   open cross   section , with a peripheral , structured wall 12 of uniform thickness . free , opposing , lengthwise running edges 16 ′, 17 ′ of side wall sections 16 and 17 respectively of wall 12 border or delineate a gap 13 in wall 12 extending along the entire length of profile member 10 . profile member 10 has three internal webs 14 a , 14 b , 14 c that stand out from a base wall section 15 of peripheral wall 12 into the interior of member 10 , so as to define together with side wall sections 16 and 17 a total of four ( 4 ) ink supply channels 20 a , 20 b , 20 c and 20 d which are open towards the gap 13 . the shapes , proportions and relative arrangement of the webs and wall sections 14 a   c , 16 , 17 are such that their respective free edges 14 a ′, 14 b ′, 14 c ′ and 16 ′, 17 ′, as viewed in the lengthwise direction and cross   section of profile member 10 , define points on a semi   circle ( indicated by a dotted line at “ a ” in fig4 ). in other words , an open slot 21 of semicircular cross   sectional shape is defined along one side of profile member 10 that runs along its extension , with each of the ink supply channels 20 a   d opening into common slot 21 . base wall section 15 of profile member 10 also includes a serrated channel 22 opening towards the exterior of member 10 , which , as best seen in fig3 , serves to receive fastening screws 23 to fixedly secure pcb 11 onto profile member 10 in a form   fitting manner between free edges 24 ( see fig4 ) of longitudinally extending curved webs 107 extending from the base wall section 15 of profile member 10 . referring again to fig3 , sealing shim 25 is received ( and secured ) within the half   circular open slot 21 . as best seen in fig3 and 5 , shim 25 includes four lengthwise extending rows of rectangular openings 26 that are equidistantly spaced in peripheral ( widthwise ) direction of shim 25 , so that three lengthwise   extending web sections 27 between the aperture rows ( of which two are visible in fig5 ) are located so as to be brought into abutting engagement against the free edges 14 a ′, 14 b ′ and 14 c ′ of webs 14 a , 14 b , 14 c of profile member 10 when shim 25 is received in slot 21 . as can be gleaned from fig4 , the free edges 16 ′ and 17 ′ of side wall sections 16 , 17 of profile member 10 are shaped such as to provide a form   lock for retaining the lengthwise extending edges 28 of shim member 25 as a snap fit . in other words , once shim 25 is mounted in profile member 10 , it provides a perforated bottom for slot 21 , which allows passage of inks from the ink supply channels 20 a   d through apertures 26 in shim 25 into slot 21 . a glue or sealant is provided where shim webs 27 and edges 28 mate with the free edges 14 a ′, 14 b ′, 14 c ′, 16 ′ and 17 ′ of profile member 10 , thereby preventing cross   leakage between ink supply channels 20 a   d along the abutting interfaces between shim 25 and profile member 10 . it will be noted from fig5 that not all apertures 26 have the same opening size . reference numerals 26 ′ indicate two such smaller apertures , the significance of which is described below , which are present in each aperture row at predetermined aperture intervals . a typical size for the full   sized apertures 26 is 2 mm × 2 mm . the shim is preferably of stainless steel , but a plastics sheet material may also be used . turning next to fig6   12 , these illustrate in different views and sections a typical printhead segment carrier 8 . carrier 8 is preferably a single micro   injection molded part made of a suitable temperature and abrasion resistant and form   holding plastics material . ( a further manufacturing operation is carried out subsequent to molding , as described below .) as best seen in fig6 and 7 , the overall external shape of carrier 8 can be described illustratively as a diametrically slit half cylinder , with a half   circular back face 91 , a partly planar front face 82 and stepped end faces 83 . fig8 shows a plan view of back face 91 and fig9 shows a plan view of front face 82 . carrier 8 has a plane of symmetry halfway along , and perpendicular to , its length , that is , as indicated by lines marked “ b ” in fig8 and 10 which lie in the plane . line “ b ” as shown in fig8 extends in a direction that will hereinafter be described as transverse to the carrier 8 . ( when the carrier 8 is installed in the assembly 1 , this direction is the same as the transverse direction of the assembly 1 .) lines marked “ c ” in fig8 , 11 and 12 together similarly indicate the position of an imaginary plane which lies between two sections of the carrier 8 of different length and whose overall cross   sectional shapes are quarter circles . line “ c ” as shown in fig9 extends in a direction that will hereinafter be described as lengthwise in the carrier 8 . ( when the carrier 8 is installed in the assembly 1 this direction is the same as the lengthwise direction of the assembly 1 .) these sections will hereinafter be referred to as the shorter and longer “ quarter cylinder ” sections 8 ′ and 8 ″, respectively , to allow referenced description of features of the carrier 8 . each stepped end face 83 includes respective outer faces 84 ′ and 85 ′ of quarter   circular   sector shaped end walls 84 and 85 and an outer face 86 ′ of an intermediate step wall 86 between and perpendicular to end walls 84 , 85 . this configuration enables carriers 8 to be placed in the slot 21 of profile 10 in such a way that adjoining carriers 8 overlap in the lengthwise direction with the step walls 86 of pairs of neighbouring carriers 8 facing each and overlapping . such an “ interlocking ” arrangement is shown in fig2 , wherein it is apparent that every one of the eleven ( 11 ) carriers 8 has an orientation , relative to its neighbouring carrier or carriers 8 , such that faces 84 ′ and 85 ′ of each carrier lie adjacent to faces 85 ′ and 84 ′, respectively , of its neighbouring carrier ( s ) 8 . in other words , each carrier 8 is so oriented in relation to its neighbouring carrier ( s ) as to be rotated relatively by 180 ° about an axis perpendicular to the face 82 . in essence , neighbouring carriers 8 will align along a common lengthwise   oriented plane defined between the step walls 86 of adjoining carriers 8 , shorter and longer quarter cylinder sections 8 ′ and 8 ″ of adjoining carriers 8 alternating with one another along the extension of slot 21 . turning now in particular to fig7 , 11 and 11 a , front face 82 of carrier 8 includes on the shorter quarter cylinder section 8 ′ a planar surface 81 . formed in surface 81 are two handling ( i . e . pick   up ) slots 87 whose purpose is described below . on the longer quarter cylinder section 8 ′, front face 82 incorporates a mounting or support surface 88 recessed with respect to edges 89 of sector   shaped end walls 84 that are co   planar with the surface 81 . as best seen in fig1 , mounting surface 88 recedes in slanting fashion from a point on the back face 91 of the longer quarter cylinder section 8 ′ towards an elongate recess 90 extending lengthwise between walls 84 . recess 90 is of constant transverse cross   section along its length and is shaped to receive in form   fitting manner one printhead segment 4 . fig1 a shows , schematically only , printhead segment 4 in position in recess 90 . mounting surface 88 is provided to accommodate in flush manner with respect to the surface 81 the terminal end of tab film 9 connected to printhead segment 4 , as is best seen in fig3 . due to the opposing orientations of neighbouring carriers 8 along the extension of assembly 1 , the tab films 9 associated with any two neighbouring carriers 8 lead away from their respective segments 4 in opposite transverse directions , as can be seen in fig2 . referring now to fig6 , 8 , 10 and 11 in particular , four rows of ink galleries or ink supply passages 92 a to 92 d of generally quadrilateral cross   section are formed within the printhead segment carrier 8 . the ink galleries 92 a to 92 d act as conduits for ink to pass from the ink supply passages 20 a to 20 d , respectively , via openings 26 in the shim 25 , to the printhead segment 4 mounted in recess 90 of the printhead segment carrier 8 . galleries 92 a   92 d extend in quasi   radial arrangement between the half   cylindrical back face 91 of carrier 8 and recess 90 located in the longer quarter cylinder section 8 ″ at front face 82 . the expression “ quasi   radial ” is used here because recess 90 is not located at a transversely central position across carrier 8 , but is offset into the longer quarter cylinder section 8 ″, so that the inner ends of galleries 92 a   92 d are similarly off   set , as further described below . each gallery 92 has a rectangular opening 93 at back face 91 . all rectangular openings 93 have the same dimension in a peripheral direction of face 91 and are equidistantly spaced around the periphery of back face 91 . moreover , the openings 93 are symmetrically located on opposing sides of the boundary between shorter quarter cylinder section 8 ′ and longer quarter cylinder section 8 ″, as represented in fig1 by the line marked “ c ”. all openings 93 in the shorter quarter cylinder section 8 ′ are of the same dimension , and equispaced , in the lengthwise direction . this also applies to the openings 93 in the longer quarter cylinder section 8 ″, except that openings 93 ′ in the longer quarter cylinder section 8 ″ which correspond to endmost galleries 92 a ′ and 92 b ′ are of smaller dimension in the lengthwise direction than the other galleries 92 a and 92 b , respectively . by way of further description of how the galleries 92 a to 92 d are formed , printhead segment carrier 8 includes a set of five ( 5 ) quasi   radially converging walls 95 which converge from back face 91 towards recess 90 at front face 82 and two of which define the faces 81 and 88 . the walls 95 perpendicularly intersect seven ( 7 ) generally semi   circular and mutually parallel walls 97 that are equidistantly spaced apart in lengthwise extension of carrier 8 . of walls 97 , the two endmost ones extending into the shorter quarter cylinder section 8 ′ provide the end walls 85 of stepped end faces 83 , thereby defining twenty   four ( 24 ) quasi   radially extending ink galleries 92 a to 92 d , of quadrilateral cross   section , in four lengthwise   extending rows each of six galleries . the walls 97 are parallel to and lie between end walls 84 . fig1 shows a cross   section through one of the lengthwise end portions of longer quarter cylinder section 8 ″ of carrier 8 . by comparison with fig1 ( which shows a cross   section through the main body of carrier 8 ), it will be seen that the quasi   radially extending walls 95 bordering end gallery 92 a ′ have the same shape as walls 95 which border galleries 92 a , whereas gallery 92 b ′ is bounded on one side by intermediate step wall 86 and by a wall 108 . fig1 also shows a wall 111 and a wall formation 112 on the wall 86 , the purpose of which is explained below . converging walls 95 are so shaped at their radially inner ends as to define four ink delivery slots 96 a to 96 d which extend lengthwise in the carrier 8 and which open into the recess 90 , as best seen in fig1 and 11 a . the slots 96 a to 96 d extend between the opposite end walls 84 of longer quarter cylinder section 8 ″ and pierce through the inner parallel walls 97 , including the endwise opposite walls 97 which form the end walls 85 of the shorter cylinder section 8 ′. fig1 shows how slots 96 a to 96 d extend and are formed within the end portions of the longer quarter cylinder section 8 ″, where the slots 96 a to 96 d are defined by the terminal ends of two of walls 95 , walls 108 , 111 and wall formation 112 , wall formation 112 in effect being a perpendicular lip of intermediate step wall 86 . the widths and transverse positioning of the ink delivery slots 96 a to 96 d are such that when a printhead segment 4 is received in recess 90 , a respective one of the slots 96 a   96 d will be in fluid communication with one only of four lengthwise oriented rows of ink supply holes 41 on rear face 42 of printhead segment 4 , compare fig1 a . each row of ink supply holes 41 corresponds to a row of printhead nozzles 43 running lengthwise along the front face 44 of printhead segment 4 . in the schematic representation of segment 4 in fig1 a , the positions of holes 41 and nozzles are indicated by dots , with no attempt made to show their actual construction . reference to pct application no . pct / au98 / 00550 will provide further details of the make   up of segment 4 . accordingly , each of the ink galleries of a specific gallery row 92 a to 92 d is in fluid communication with one only of the rows of ink supply holes 41 . once a printhead segment 4 is form fittingly received in recess 90 and sealingly secured with its rear face 42 against the terminal inner ends of walls 95 , and wall formations 108 , 111 and 112 ( using a suitable sealant or adhesive ), cross   communication and ink bleeding between slots 96 a   96 d via recess 90 is not possible . when a carrier 8 is installed in its correct position lengthwise in the slot 21 of profile 10 , compare fig3 , each opening 93 in its back face 91 aligns with one of the openings 26 in the shim 25 . smaller openings 26 ′ in the shim 25 correspond to openings 93 ′ of the smaller galleries 92 a ′ and 92 b ′ of carrier 8 . therefore , each one of the ink supply channels 20 a to 20 d is in fluid communication with one only of the rows of ink galleries 92 a to 92 d , respectively , and so with one only of the slots 96 a to 96 d respectively and only one of the rows of ink supply holes 41 . a suitable glue or sealant is provided at mating surfaces of the shim 25 and the carrier 8 to prevent leakage of ink from any of the channels 20 a to 20 d to an incorrect one of the galleries 92 , as described further below . the symmetrical location ( mentioned above ) of openings 93 on back face 91 of carrier 8 , which is matched by the openings 26 in shim 25 , enables the carrier 8 to be received in the slot 21 in either of the two orientations shown in fig3 , with in both cases each row of ink galleries 92 a to 92 d aligning with one only of the ink supply channels 20 a to 20 d . as mentioned above , the longer quarter cylinder section 8 ″ of carrier 8 has two galleries 92 a ′ and 92 b ′ at each lengthwise end that have no counterpart in the shorter section 8 ′. these galleries 92 a ′ and 92 b ′ provide direct ink supply paths to that part of their associated ink delivery slots 96 a and 96 b located in the longer quarter cylinder section 8 ″, and thus to the ink supply holes 41 of the printhead segment 4 that are located near the lengthwise terminal ends of segment 4 when secured within recess 90 . there are no corresponding quasi   radial galleries to supply ink to the end regions of the slots 96 c and 96 d . however , it is desirable to provide direct ink supply to the end portions of the other two slots 96 c and 96 d as well , without reliance on lengthwise flow within the slots 96 c and 96 d of ink that has passed through galleries 92 c and 92 d respectively . this is ensured by provision of ink supply chambers 99 c and 99 d which are shown in fig1 and which supply ink to the slots 96 c and 96 d , respectively . chambers 99 c and 99 d are bounded by the walls 84 , 86 , and wall formations 108 , 111 and 112 , are open towards slots 96 c and 96 d , respectively , and are in fluid communication through holes 113 and 114 in an endmost wall 97 with endmost ones of ink galleries 92 c and 92 d , respectively . the holes 113 and 114 have outlines shaped to match the transverse cross   sectional shapes of the chambers 99 c and 99 d , respectively , as shown in fig1 , and the means whereby holes 113 and 114 are formed is described below . fig1 and 14 show a first end cap 50 which is sealingly secured to an open terminal longitudinal end of profile member 10 , as may be seen in fig1 and 2 . cap 50 is molded from a plastics material and it incorporates a generally planar wall portion 51 that extends perpendicularly to a lengthwise axis of profile member 10 . four tubular stubs 55 a   55 d are integrally moulded with planar wall portion 51 on side 52 of wall portion 51 which will face away from support profile 10 when end cap 50 is secured thereto . on the planar wall side 53 which will face the longitudinal terminal end of support profile 10 ( see fig1 ), four hollow   shaped stubs 57 a   57 d are integrally moulded with planar wall portion 51 . as best seen in fig1 , ink supply conduits 56 a to 56 d are defined within tubular stubs 55 a to 55 d respectively , extend through planar wall portion 51 , and open within shaped stubs 57 a to 57 d , respectively , located on the other sides of cap 50 . the shape of each one of the insert stubs 57 a to 57 d , as seen in transverse cross   section , corresponds respectively to one of the ink supply channels 20 a to 20 d of support profile so that , when cap 50 is secured to the terminal axial end of support profile 10 , the walls of stubs 57 a   57 d are received form   fittingly in ink supply channels 20 a   20 d to prevent cross   migration of ink therebetween . the face 53 abuts a terminal end face of the profile 10 . preferably , glue or a sealant can be applied to the mating surfaces of profile 10 and cap 50 to enhance the sealing function . the tubular stubs 55 a   55 d serve as female connectors for pliable / flexible ink supply hoses ( not illustrated ) that can be connected thereto sealingly , thereby to supply ink to the integral ink supply channels 20 a   20 d of support profile 10 . a further stub 58 , d   shaped in transverse cross   section , is integrally molded to planar wall portion 51 at side 53 . in completed assembly 1 , the curved wall 71 , semi   circular in transverse cross   section , of retaining stub 58 seals against the inside surface of shim 25 , with the terminal edge of shim 25 abutting a peripheral ridge 72 around the stub 58 . preferably , to avoid cross   migration of ink among channels 20 a to 20 d , an adhesive or sealant is provided between the shim 25 and wall 71 . the stub 58 assists in retaining the shim 25 in slot 21 . a second end cap 60 , which is shown in fig1 and 16 , is mounted to the other end of the profile 10 opposite to cap 50 . cap 60 has insert stubs 67 a to 67 d and a retaining stub 68 identical in arrangement and shape to stubs 57 a to 57 d and stub 58 , respectively , of end cap 50 . insert stubs 67 a to 67 d and retention stub 68 are integrally molded with a planar wall portion 61 , and in the completed assembly 1 seal off the individual ink supply channels 20 a   20 d from one another , to prevent cross   migration of ink among them . wall 77 of the retention stub 68 abuts the shim 25 in the same way as described above . a sealant or adhesive is preferably used with end cap 60 in the same way ( and for the same purpose ) as described above in respect of end cap 50 . whereas end cap 50 enables connection of ink supply hoses to the printhead assembly 1 , end cap 60 has no tubular stubs on exterior face 62 of planar wall portion 61 . instead , four tortuous grooves 65 a to 65 d are formed on exterior face 62 , and terminate at holes 66 a to 66 d , respectively , extending through wall portion 61 . each one of holes 66 a to 66 d opens into a respective one of the channels 20 a to 20 d so that when the cap 60 is in place on the profile 10 , each one of the grooves 65 a to 65 d is in fluid communication with a respective one of the channels 20 a to 20 d . the grooves 65 a   65 d permit bleeding   off of air during priming of the printhead assembly 1 with ink , as holes 66 a   66 d permit air expulsion from the ink supply channels 20 a   20 d of support profile 10 via grooves 65 a   65 d . grooves 65 a   65 d are capped under a translucent plastic film 69 bonded to outer face 62 . translucent plastic film 69 thus also serves the purpose of allowing visual confirmation that the ink supply channels 20 a   20 d of profile 10 are properly primed . for charging the ink supply channels 20 a   20 d with ink , film 69 is folded back ( as shown in fig1 ) to partially uncover grooves 65 a   65 d , so that displaced air may bleed out as ink enters the grooves 65 a   65 d through holes 66 a   66 d . when ink is visible behind film 69 in each groove 65 a   65 d , film 69 is folded towards face 62 and bonded against face 62 to sealingly cover face 62 and so cap   off grooves 65 a   65 d and isolate them from one another . referring to fig1 ( and see also fig3 and 4 ), the printed circuit board ( pcb ) 11 locates between edges 24 formed on profile 10 , and is secured by screw fasteners 23 which engage with the serrations in elongate channel 22 of support profile 10 . the pcb 11 contains three surface mounted halftoning chips 73 , a data connector 74 , printhead power and ground busbars 75 and decoupling capacitors 76 . side walls 16 , 17 of support profile 10 are rounded near the edges 24 to avoid damage to the tab films 9 when these are wound about profile 10 . the electronic components 73 and 76 are specific to the use of memjet chips as the printhead segments 4 , and would of course , if other another printhead technology were to be used , be substituted with other components as necessitated by that technology . the shield plate 5 illustrated in fig1 , which is a thin sheet of stainless steel , is bonded with sealant such as a silicon sealant onto the printhead segment carriers 8 . the shield plate 5 shields the tab films 9 and the printhead segments 4 from physical damage and also serves to provide an airtight seal around the printhead segments 4 when the assembly 1 is capped during idle periods . the multi   part layout of the printhead assembly 1 that has been described in detail above has the advantage that the printhead segment carriers 8 , which interface directly with the printhead segments 4 and which must therefore be manufactured with very small tolerances , are separate from other parts , including particularly the main support frame ( profile 10 ) which may therefore be less tightly toleranced . as noted above , the printhead segment carriers 8 are precision injection micro   moldings . moldings of the required size and complexity are obtainable using existing micromolding technology and plastics materials such as abs , for example . tolerances of +/− 10 microns on specified dimensions are achievable including the ink supply grooves 96 a   96 d , and their relative location with respect to the recess 90 in which the printhead segments 4 are received . such tolerances are suitable for this application . other material selection criteria are thermal stability and compatibility with other materials to be used in the assembly 1 , such as inks and sealants . the profile 10 is preferably an aluminum alloy extrusion . tolerances specified at +/− 100 microns have been found suitable for such extrusions , and are achievable as well . fig1 , 20 and 21 are schematic representations only , intended to provide an understanding of the construction of an injection molding die used in the manufacture of a printhead segment carrier 8 . a multi   part die 100 is used , having a fixed base die part 104 , which in use defines the face 82 , recess 90 and slots 96 a to 96 d of the carrier 8 , and a multi   part upper die part 102 . the upper die part 102 is closed against the base part 104 for molding , and includes a part 101 with multiple fingers 101 a which in use form the galleries 92 b ( including galleries 92 b ) and parts 106 which are fixed relative to part 101 . also included in the upper part 102 are die parts 103 which are movable relative to the part 101 and which have fingers 103 a to form the remaining galleries 92 a , 92 c and 92 d . parts 103 seat against parts 106 when molding is underway . spaces between the fingers 101 a and 103 a correspond to the walls 97 . in use of the die 100 , terminal tips of the fingers 101 a and 103 a close against blades 105 which in use form the ink supply slots 96 a   96 d of carrier 8 and which are mounted to male base 104 to be detachable and replaceable when necessary . base die part 104 also has inserts 104 a which in use form the pickup slots 87 . because zero draft is preferred on the stepped end faces 83 in this application , the die 100 also has two movable end pieces ( not shown , for clarity ) which in use of the die 100 are movable generally axially to close against the upper die part 102 and which are shaped to define the end faces 84 ′, 85 ′ and 86 ′ of carrier 8 . fig2 shows a schematic transverse cross   section of the mold 100 when closed , with areas in black corresponding to the carrier 8 being molded . as was mentioned above , the two opposite end portions of the larger quarter cylinder section of carrier 8 incorporate two ink supply chambers 99 c and 99 d ( see fig1 ) to provide ink to the ink supply slots 96 c and 96 d in that region of the carrier 8 . these chambers 99 c and 99 d and associated communication holes 113 and 114 in parallel walls 97 that lead into the neighbouring galleries 92 c and 92 d , are formed in an operation subsequent to molding , by laser cutting openings of the required shape in the end walls 84 and the neighbouring inner parallel walls 97 from each end . the openings cut in end walls 84 are only necessary so as to access the inner walls 97 , and are therefore subsequently permanently plugged using appropriately shaped plugs 115 as shown in fig6 . extrusions usable for profile 10 can be produced in continuous lengths and precision cut to the length required . the particular support profile 10 illustrated is 15 . 4 mm × 25 . 4 mm in section and about 240 mm in length . these dimensions , together with the layout and arrangement of the walls 16 and 17 and internal webs 14 a to 14 c , have been found suitable to ensure adequate ink supply to eleven ( 11 ) memjet printhead segments 4 carried in the support profile to achieve four   color printing at 120 pages per minute ( ppm ). support profiles with larger cross   sectional dimensions can be employed for very long printhead assemblies and / or for extremely high   speed printing where greater volumes of ink are required . longer support profiles may of course be used , but are likely to require cross   bracing and location into a more rigid chassis to avoid alignment problems of individual printhead segments , for example in the case of a wide format printer of 54 ″ ( 1372 mm ) or more . an important step in manufacturing ( and assembling ) the assembly 1 is achieving the necessary , very high level of precision in relative positioning of the printhead segments 4 , and here too the construction of the assembly 1 as described above is advantageous . a suitable manufacturing sequence that ensures such high relative positioning of printheads on the support profile will now be described . after manufacture and successful testing of an individual printhead segment 4 , its associated tab film 9 is bumped and then bonded to bond pads along an edge of the printhead segment 4 . that is , the tab film is physically secured to segment 4 and the necessary electrical connections are made . the terms “ bumped ” and “ bonded ” will be familiar to persons skilled in the arts where tab films are used . the printhead carrier 8 is then primed with adhesive on all those surfaces facing into recess 90 that mate and must seal with the printhead segment 4 , see fig1 a , i . e . along the length of the radially   inner edges of walls 95 , 108 and 111 , the face of formation 112 and on inner faces of walls 84 . the printhead segment 4 is then secured in place in recess 90 with its tab film 9 attached . extremely accurate alignment of the printhead segment 4 within recess 90 of printhead segment carrier 8 is not necessarily required ( but is preferred ), because relative alignment of all segments 4 at the support profile 10 is carried out later , as is described below . the assembly of the printhead segment 4 , printhead segment carrier 8 and tab film 9 is preferably tested at this point for correct operation using ink or water , before being positioned for placement in the slot 21 of support profile 10 . the support profile 10 is accurately cut to length ( where it has been manufactured in a length longer than that required , for example by extrusion ), faced and cleaned to enable good mating with the end caps 50 and 60 . a glue wheel is run the entire length of semi   circular slot 21 , priming the terminal edges 14 a ′, 14 b ′, 14 c ′ of webs 14 a   14 c and edges 16 ′, 17 ′ of profile side walls 16 , 17 with adhesive that will bond the sealing shim 25 into place in slot 21 once sealing shim 25 is placed into it with preset distance from its terminal ends (+/− 10 microns ). the shim 25 is snap   fitted into place at edges 16 ′, 17 ′ and the glue is allowed to set . next , end caps 50 and 60 are bonded into place whereby ( ink channel sealing ) insert stubs 57 a   57 d and 67 a   67 d are received in ink channels 20 a   20 d of profile 10 , and faces 71 and 77 of retention stubs 58 and 68 , respectively , lie on shim 25 . this sub   assembly provides a chassis in which to successively place , align and secure further sub   assemblies ( hereinafter called “ carrier subassemblies ”) each consisting of a printhead segment carrier 8 with its respective printhead segment 4 and tab film 9 already secured in place thereon . a first carrier sub   assembly is primed with glue on the back face 91 of its printhead segment carrier 8 . at least the edges of walls 95 and 86 are primed . a glue wheel , running lengthwise , is preferably used in this operation . after priming with glue , the carrier sub   assembly is picked up by a manipulator arm engaging into pick   up slots 87 on front face 82 of carrier 8 and placed next to the stub 58 of end cap 50 ( or the stub 68 of cap 60 ) at one end of slot 21 in profile 10 . the glue employed is of slow   setting or heat   activated type , thereby to allow a small level of positional manipulation of each carrier subassembly , lengthwise in the slot 21 , before final setting of the glue . with the first carrier subassembly finally secured to the shim 25 within the slot 21 , a second carrier sub   assembly is then picked up , primed with glue as above , and placed in a 180   degree   rotated position ( as described above , and as may be seen in fig3 ) next to the first carrier sub   assembly onto shim 25 and within the slot 21 . the second carrier sub   assembly is then positioned lengthwise so that there is correct lengthwise relative positioning of its printhead segment 4 and the segment 4 of the previously   placed segment 4 , as determined using suitable fiducial marks ( not shown ) on the exposed front surface 44 of each of the printhead segments 4 . that is , lengthwise alignment is carried out between successive printhead segments 4 , even though it is the printhead segment carrier 8 that is actually manipulated . this relative alignment is carried out to such ( sub   micron ) accuracy as is required to match the printing resolution capability of the printhead segments 4 . finally , the bonding of the second carrier sub   assembly to shim 25 is completed . the above process is then repeated with further carrier sub   assemblies being successively positioned , aligned , and bonded into place , until all carrier subassemblies are in position within the slot 21 and bonded in their correct positions . the shield plate 5 has a thin film of silicon sealant applied to its underside and is mated to the printhead segment carriers 8 and tab films 9 along the entire length of the printhead assembly 1 . by suitable choice of adhesive properties of the silicon sealant , the shield plate 5 can be made removable to enable access to the printhead segment carriers 8 , printhead segments 4 and tab films 9 for servicing and / or exchange . a sub   assembly of pcb 11 and printhead control and ancillary components 73 to 76 is secured to profile 10 using four screws 23 . the tab films 9 are wrapped around the exterior walls 16 , 17 of profile 10 and are bumped and bonded ( i . e . physically and electrically connected ) to the pcb 11 . see fig1 . finally , the completed assembly 1 is connected at the ink inlet stubs 55 a   d of end cap 50 to suitable ink supplies , primed as described above and sealed using sealing film 69 of end cap 60 . power and signal connections are completed and the inkjet printhead assembly 1 is ready for final testing and subsequent use . it will be apparent to persons skilled in the art that many variations of the above   described assembly and components are possible . for example , fig1 shows a shim 125 that is substantially the same as shim 25 , including having openings 126 and 126 ′ corresponding to the openings 26 and 26 ′ in shim 25 , save for longitudinally extending rim webs 128 which , when the shim 125 is mounted to a support profile 110 , abut in surface   engaging manner against the outside of the terminal ends of side walls 116 , 117 of profile 110 instead of being snap   fittingly received between them as is the case with shim 25 . this arrangement permits wider tolerances to be used in the manufacture of the support profile 110 without compromising the mating capability of the shim 125 and the profile 110 . in yet another possible arrangement , the shim 25 could be eliminated entirely , with the printhead segment carriers 8 then bearing and sealing directly on the edges 14 a ′  14 c ′ and 16 ′, 17 ′ of the webs 14 a   14 c and side walls 16 , 17 at slot 21 of support profile 10 . it will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that still further variations and modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention . the embodiments of the present invention as described above are in no sense intended to be restrictive .
