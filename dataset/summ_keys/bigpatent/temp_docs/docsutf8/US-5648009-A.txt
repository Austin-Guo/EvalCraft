an apparatus for mounting a mold box on a machine for forming molded concrete products includes a mold defining a cavity for receiving cement having a pair of opposed side plates and a pair of opposed mounting brackets . a mold support frame is further included having a pair of opposed side beams and a pair of opposed end brackets , with a connecting device for mounting the support frame on the machine . a pair of opposed substantially parallel slots is formed on the support frame side beams and a sliding plate is receivable in the slots and slidable therealong . a slot is also formed on one of the mold mounting brackets , such that the sliding plate is receivable in the slot formed on the mold mounting bracket .
turning now to fig1 and 2 , indicated generally at 10 in fig1 is a mold box assembly incorporating the present invention , with a mold box , shown generally at 12 , received in a mold box support frame , shown generally at 14 . as best seen in fig2 mold box 12 includes a pair of opposed , substantially parallel side plates 16 , 18 shown in dashed lines , and a pair of opposed , substantially parallel mounting brackets 20 , 22 which are positioned at opposite ends of side plates 16 , 18 . mounting brackets 20 , 22 are secured to side plates 16 , 18 by bolts indicated generally at 24 . partition plates 26 , 28 , shown in dashed lines , extend between side plates 16 , 18 and include end surfaces , such as surfaces 30 , 32 shown in fig1 which flushly abut an interior side of each side plate . the spaces between partition plates , such as plates 26 , 28 , provide cavities into which wet cement is compressed and thereafter stripped therefrom to form a molded concrete product . a pair of elongate slots or couplers 34 , 36 are formed centrally on the outer planar surfaces or sides of mounting brackets 20 , 22 . coupler 34 includes slots 34a , 34b , 34c . coupler 36 is substantially identical to coupler 34 . mounting bracket 22 is substantially identical to mounting bracket 20 . coupler 36 is also substantially identical to coupler 34 . as illustrated in fig1 and 2 , support frame 14 includes a pair of opposed , substantially parallel side beams 42 , 44 and a pair of opposed , substantially parallel end brackets 46 , 48 positioned at opposite ends of side beams 42 , 44 , which together define a substantially rectangular frame having four corner portions as shown . an alignment pin , such as pin 58 shown in fig2 is mounted on the end bracket at each corner portion and an alignment bore , such as bore 60 , coaxial with the pin , is formed on the side beam . the bores are sized and positioned so that , when each bore has its associated alignment pin therein , the mold box support frame is sufficiently aligned to form molded products , all as more fully described in my u . s . patent application ser . no . 08 / 361 , 790 for self   aligning mold box assembly . as seen in fig2 a pair of elongate slots 62 , 64 is formed on the inner sides of side beams 42 , 44 . a pair of substantially rectangular spacers or plates 66 , 68 , shown in fig1 and 2 , are provided for assembly 10 . spacer 66 has an expanse , shown generally in fig2 at 70 , 72 , disposed adjacent each of its ends 74 , 76 . spacer 68 also has an expanse 78 , 80 ( not shown ) disposed adjacent each of its ends . expanses 70 , 72 and 78 , 80 of spacers 66 , 68 are received in slots 62 , 64 respectively , of side beams 42 , 44 and slidably travel therealong . the sides 82 , 84 of spacers 66 , 68 respectively , are provided with elongate lip portions 86 , 88 which couple with elongate slots or couplers 34 , 36 on mounting brackets 20 , 22 . as best seen in fig3 and 4 , a pair of retractors , one of which is retractor 90 , are included in assembly 10 for moving spacers 66 , 68 in order to adjustably accommodate exchange of smaller mold boxes , such as box 12 , in assembly 10 . the other retractor , not visible in the drawings , is located at the opposite end of mold box assembly 10 and is substantially identical to retractor 90 . retractor 90 includes a bore 94 disposed centrally in frame end bracket 46 , and a threaded bore 96 , disposed centrally in a side of spacer 66 , with the bore and the threaded bore being coaxial with respect to each other . retractor 90 further includes an associated bolt 98 , which is threaded adjacent its end so as to engage spacer 66 when the bolt is fully extended through the bores . each frame end bracket , such as end bracket 46 , further includes a pair of threaded bores , such as bores 100 , 102 ( fig3 and 4 ), spaced apart from each other , and each spacer , such as spacer 66 , has a pair of corresponding bores having ends , such as bores 104 , 106 , disposed in the spacer , with the threaded bores in the end brackets and the bores in the spacers being coaxial with respect to each other . a pair of associated bolts threaded adjacent their heads , such as bolts 108 , 110 , are provided to engage the threaded bores , such as bores 100 , 102 , in the end brackets , such as end bracket 46 , when the bolts are fully extended through the end brackets with the ends of the bolts abutting the ends of the spacer bores , such as spacer bores 104 , 106 . lock washers , such as washers 112 , 114 , are provided for each bolt , such as bolts 108 , 110 , to lock the bolts in place , as shown in fig4 . a mold box having substantially shorter side plates than the side beams of the mold box support frame may be adapted by the method of the invention by removing one of the frame end brackets , such as end bracket 46 , and installing in the frame a pair of spacers , such as spacers 66 , 68 , with the expanses of each spacer received in the slots , such as slots 62 , 64 , of side beams 42 , 44 to slidably travel therealong . the end bracket is then fixedly mounted on the ends of the frame side beams . the retractor 90 retractably moves spacer 66 to accommodate placement or exchange of mold boxes , such as box 12 , in assembly 10 . bolt 98 is threaded through central bore 94 on the frame end bracket and into threaded bore 96 to engage spacer 66 , and move the spacer outwardly toward the frame end brackets , as best seen in fig3 . the mold box is placed in the frame , and the spacers are slid into the slots on the mounting brackets of the mold box by movement of bolts , such as bolts 108 , 110 through threaded bores 100 , 102 in the end brackets , such as end bracket 46 , with the ends of the bolts abutting the end of the spacers bores , such as spacer bores 104 , 106 . the lock washers , such as washers 112 , 114 then are engaged to lock the bolts in place , as shown in fig4 . so positioned , the spacers are flushly received in the slots in the box mounting brackets and the mold is ready to be filled with wet cement material . it can thus be seen that the structure and method provided by the present invention produces important advantages . first , the vertical vibration forces imparted to mold box assembly 10 during operation are distributed over a relatively larger area . specifically , the top and bottom surfaces of spacer 66 are substantially flushly abutted against the top and bottom surfaces of slots 34a , 34b , 34c . similarly , top and bottom surfaces of spacer 66 are substantially flushly abutted against the top and bottom edges of slots 62 , 64 . vertical vibration forces set up in mold box 12 are thus spread over a larger area than if mold box 12 were , e . g ., simply bolted to mold box support frame 14 at several locations . when bolts are used , as in prior art adapters , only the heads of the bolt resist upward forces imparted to the mold box . another advantage of the present invention relates to the ease of changing a mold box , like mold box 12 , out of the mold box support frame and mounting a different mold box thereon . to achieve the same , bolts 108 , 110 are unscrewed from the position of fig4 to that of fig3 and bolt 98 is inserted through bore 94 and into threaded bore 96 . threaded bolt 98 moves spacer 66 into configuration of fig4 to that of fig3 . when the same procedure preformed on the structure associated with spacer 68 at the opposite end of the assembly , both spacers are withdrawn to the position of fig3 thereby allowing mold box 12 to be removed by withdrawing the same through the top or bottom of mold box support frame 14 . the mold box to be installed , which includes mounting brackets substantially identical to mounting brackets 20 , 22 , is inserted into frame 14 in the same position as mold box 12 is depicted in fig1 . thereafter , bolt 98 ( in fig3 ) is removed , bolts 108 , 110 are screwed in to slide spacer 66 into bores 100 , 102 the configuration shown in fig4 . substantially the same procedure is performed on structure at the opposite end of assembly 14 to urge spacer 68 into the slots making up coupler 36 in the same fashion that spacer 66 is urged into slots 34a , 34b , 34c . while a preferred construction for , and methods of practicing the invention have been disclosed herein , it is appreciated that variations and modifications may take place without departing from the spirit of the invention .
