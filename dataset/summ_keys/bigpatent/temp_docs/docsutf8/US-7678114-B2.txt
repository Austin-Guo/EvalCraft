a surgical installation tool to insert a vertebral implant into a patient includes an elongated handle and a head attached to one end . the vertebral implant may be attached to the head . the head may include an engagement member that is movable between engaged and released positions . the engagement member may be outwardly biased so that it naturally rests in the released position . the engagement member may be inwardly movable from the released position to the engaged position . a reactive force caused by the inward deflection may supply the attachment force between the installation tool and the vertebral implant . the attachment between the vertebral implant to the installation tool may be maintained while the engagement member is in the engaged position .
the various embodiments disclosed herein are directed to a low profile surgical implant insertion tool . an exemplary embodiment of the insertion tool 10 is illustrated in fig1 . in this particular embodiment , the insertion tool 10 is illustrated holding a hook implant 50 . the hook 50 may be a conventional distraction hook or other hook implant such as that belonging to the cd horizon ® legacy ™ spinal system available from medtronic sofamor danek in memphis , tenn . various types of hooks may be held and positioned using the insertion tool 10 , including for example pedicle hooks , supralaminar hooks , infralaminar hooks , and transverse process hooks . in fig1 , the hook 50 is held by the exemplary insertion tool 10 . in contrast , fig2 shows the hook 50 separated from the insertion tool 10 . the insertion tool 10 includes an elongated bar 12 having a head or retainer 20 disposed at an end of the elongated bar 12 . the insertion tool 10 may be manipulated during surgery by maneuvering the elongated bar 12 to place the hook 50 in a desired position relative to a vertebral member ( not shown ). the retainer 20 is configured to hold the hook 50 in a releasable manner . thus , once the hook 50 is positioned , the insertion tool 10 may be extracted , leaving the hook 50 substantially in the desired position . the retainer 20 is shaped to fill much of the saddle portion 52 of the hook 50 . in the embodiment shown , the saddle portion 52 comprises spaced apart side walls 54 having a substantially u   shaped open channel therebetween . it is between these side walls 54 that a spinal rod 60 of a spinal implant system is inserted . in the illustrated embodiment of a hook 50 , the side walls 54 include a threaded central portion 56 into which a retaining member 70 is inserted to secure the rod 60 within the saddle portion 52 of the hook 50 . the retainer 20 has a generally u   shaped configuration , which permits insertion of the retainer 20 into the saddle portion 52 of the hook 50 . the retainer 20 further comprises a plurality of biasing members 22 . in this embodiment , the biasing members 22 are configured as cantilevered leaf springs and operate as engagement elements that contact the hook 50 . furthermore , in the embodiment shown , the retainer 20 has four biasing members 22 , though a different number may be used . the insertion tool 10 is configured such that , when the retainer 20 is inserted into the saddle 52 of the hook 50 as shown in fig1 , the biasing members 22 frictionally engage inner faces 58 of the side walls 54 on either side of the threaded portion 56 . the biasing force applied by the biasing members 22 against the inner side walls 58 of the hook 50 is sufficient to support the weight of the hook 50 . however , as suggested above , the retainer 20 and the biasing members 22 hold the hook 50 in a releasable manner . thus , the biasing members 22 should not create so large a retaining force that the insertion tool 10 cannot be extracted from the hook 50 as needed . the exemplary insertion tool 10 also includes an enlarged flange 14 adjacent to the retainer 20 . the flange 14 serves to limit the depth to which the hook 50 may be inserted onto the retainer 20 . in addition , the flange 14 permits the application of an insertion force in the direction indicated by the letter f in fig1 . for instance , it may be necessary to apply an insertion force in the direction of arrow f during surgical installation of the hook 50 . however , once the hook 50 is positioned as desired , the arrangement of the retainer 20 and flange 14 allow the insertion tool 10 to be removed in the directions indicated by arrow a or arrow p or some vector combination thereof . these arrows f , a , and p are shown relative to an x   y   z coordinate system . note also that the direction of deflection of the biasing members 22 caused by installation of the hook 50 onto the retainer 20 in one or more embodiments may be substantially aligned with the y   coordinate . fig3 a shows arrows a and p relative to the same x   y   z coordinate system and to the entire insertion tool 10 and hook 50 . notably , the elongated bar 12 is substantially aligned with the direction of removal along arrow p . this direction p is towards the open part of the u   shaped channel in the saddle 52 ( see fig2 ). this direction p is also substantially perpendicular to the rod 60 that lies within the u   shaped channel in saddle 52 . the ability to remove the insertion tool in this direction may help preserve the desire to maintain small surgical incisions and may also prevent interference with vertebrae or other anatomy ( not shown ). furthermore , since the retainer 20 fits substantially within the interior of the saddle 52 , the extent to which the insertion tool 10 is a limiting factor in guiding and placing the hook 50 in a desired position may be minimized . also , the size of the insertion tool 10 in the direction of arrow a may be minimized by adjusting the size of the bend 16 in the elongated bar 12 and the distance between the bend 16 and the distal end at which the hook 50 is attached . as described above and shown in fig2 , the retainer 20 uses friction to grasp the inner surfaces 58 of side walls 54 of the hook 50 . consequently , there is some amount of flexibility in orienting the hook 50 onto the retainer 20 . that is , as fig3 b shows , the hook 50 may be rotated slightly up and down in the x   z plane as indicated by the arrows h relative to the insertion tool 10 . this additional degree of flexibility may further improve approach angles during surgical installation as well as in removing the insertion tool 10 from the hook 50 . the u   shaped configuration of the retainer 20 is more clearly visible in the frontal view shown in fig4 . this particular view is aligned with a longitudinal axis labeled d . the bottom surface 24 is curved to fit within the saddle 52 of hook 50 . in one embodiment , the bottom surface 24 of retainer 20 has a radius of curvature that matches that of the bottom of saddle 52 ( see fig2 ). this same radius of curvature may also correspond to a diameter of rod 60 ( also shown in fig2 ). fig4 also illustrates a small outward bow of the biasing members 22 relative to the width of the bottom surface 24 . the biasing members 22 are resilient and deflect inward , conforming to the size of the saddle 52 of hook 50 ( as shown in fig1 ). the reaction force caused by this inward deflection supplies the friction that holds the hook 50 onto the retainer 20 . fig5 shows a top view of the exemplary retainer 20 , including the biasing members 22 , in relation to the flange 14 and elongated bar 12 . notably , the middle portion 26 between the biasing members 22 extends wider than the biasing members 22 ( also visible in fig3 ). when the retainer 20 is inserted into the saddle 52 of the hook 50 as shown in fig1 , these middle portions 26 fit within the threaded portion 56 of the hook 50 . a close fit between the middle portions 26 of retainer 20 and the threaded portions 56 of hook 50 may contribute to a more robust retention , reducing unwanted motion between the two parts 10 , 50 . a widened middle portion 26 may omitted in cases where the hook 50 or other vertebral implant does not have the threaded portions 56 . fig5 also shows that the retainer 20 is oriented along the longitudinal axis labeled d . the biasing members 22 are positioned in a free state and are spaced apart a first width w 1 in a direction substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis d . when the hook 50 is attached as illustrated in fig1 , the biasing members 22 deflect inward towards an engaged state where the biasing members are space apart a second width illustrated by the dimension labeled w 2 . this inward deflection of the biasing members 22 creates the outward retention force that keeps the hook 50 attached to the retainer 20 . note that the length of the retainer in the left to right direction of fig5 remains substantially constant . an alternative embodiment of a retainer 120 is illustrated in fig6   9 . fig6 shows an exploded view of components in this particular embodiment . the retainer 120 uses a biasing member 122 to apply a retaining force to a hook 50 . in the embodiment shown , the biasing member 122 is a compression ring . the biasing member 122 fits within a recess 126 formed between retaining walls 128 of a substantially u   shaped retainer body 124 protruding from flange 14 . in one embodiment , this retainer body 124 is sized to fit within the saddle 52 of the hook 50 shown in fig2 . the biasing member 123 is captured within the recess 126 by a substantially cylindrical plug 130 . the plug 130 includes three portions 132 , 134 , 136 defined by different diameters . a flange portion 132 has a diameter that is larger than the inner diameter of the biasing member 122 . the body portion 134 has a diameter that is smaller than the inner diameter of the biasing member 122 . further , a plug portion 136 has a diameter that is sized to fit within a corresponding aperture 138 in the retainer body 124 . the plug portion 136 may be threaded to fit within a corresponding threaded aperture 138 . alternatively , the plug portion 136 may be press fitted into the aperture 138 . in other embodiments , the plug portion 136 may be loosely fit into aperture 138 , but retained using an adhesive compound . as configured , the plug 130 may retain the biasing member 122 as shown in fig7 . the biasing member 122 further comprises a gap 123 that is larger than a corresponding orienting feature 133 in the body portion 134 of the plug 130 . this relationship among these features is more readily visible in fig8 , which shows a top view of the exemplary retainer 120 . the gap 123 in biasing member 122 is aligned with the orienting feature 133 . the gap 123 is wider than the orienting feature 133 as evidenced by the existence of gaps 123 on either side of the orienting feature 133 . also as indicated , the body portion 134 ( see fig6 ) has a diameter that is smaller than the biasing member 122 . this difference in size allows resilient compression of the biasing member 122 in the direction indicated by the arrows labeled c in fig8 , which is substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis d . fig8 also shows that the biasing member 122 is marginally wider than the retaining walls 128 of the retainer body 124 . fig9 illustrates that this configuration mates with a corresponding configuration in a hook 50 . specifically , the biasing member 122 in the present embodiment engages the threaded portion 56 of the sidewalls 54 of hook 50 . fig9 also shows that upon inserting the retainer 120 into the hook 50 , the biasing member 122 compresses slightly , creating a reaction force that frictionally engages the hook 50 . the compression of the biasing member 122 is visible in the vicinity of the orienting feature 133 , where the amount of gap 123 on either side of the orienting feature 133 is reduced as compared to fig8 . in yet another embodiment of a retainer 220 illustrated in fig1 and 11 , a biasing member 222 is used to apply a frictional retaining force when compressed in the direction of arrows c . a single biasing member 222 is illustrated though a plurality may be used . however , in contrast with previously described embodiments , the biasing member 222 in this embodiment does not directly contact a hook 50 of the type shown in the various figures . instead , the biasing member 222 imparts a reactive force on complementary plungers 226 disposed within a head 224 and that are configured to fit within the threaded portion 56 of the sidewalls 54 of hook 50 . fig1 shows this same embodiment with the hook 50 attached to the retainer 220 and the plungers 226 compressed as compared to the position shown in fig1 . as with the embodiment of the retainer 20 shown in fig1   2 , and 4   5 , the retention mechanism created by biasing members 122 and 222 provides some flexibility in attaching a hook 50 . that is , the adjustability represented by the arrows labeled h in fig3 b is equally applicable to these embodiments of the retainer 120 , 220 . accordingly , the hook 50 may be rotated slightly up and down in the x   z plane as indicated by the arrows h relative to the insertion tool 10 . this additional degree of flexibility may further improve approach angles during surgical installation as well as in removing the insertion tool 10 from the hook 50 . in another embodiment of a retainer 320 illustrated in fig1 and 13 , a biasing member 222 similar to that shown in fig1 and 11 is used to apply a frictional retaining force when compressed in the direction of arrow c . a single biasing member 222 is illustrated though a plurality may be used . in contrast with the embodiment shown in fig1 and 11 , the biasing member 222 imparts a reactive force on a single plunger 226 that is disposed within a head 324 and is also configured to fit within the threaded portion 56 of sidewalls 54 of hook 50 . fig1 shows this same embodiment with the hook 50 attached to the retainer 320 and the single plunger 226 compressed as compared to the position shown in fig1 . the present invention may be carried out in other specific ways than those herein set forth without departing from the scope and essential characteristics of the invention . for example , while certain embodiments described above have contemplated engaging a threaded portion 56 on the interior of the sidewall 54 of hook 50 , other hooks may have threaded portions on the exterior of the sidewall 54 or transversely formed through the sidewalls 54 . however , the friction forces applied by the various biasing members 22 , 122 , 222 may be generally applied to the inner surface 58 of the sidewalls 54 , regardless of the positioning or existence of threads . furthermore , while a hook 50 has been used as an exemplary implant that may be placed with the insertion tool 10 , other implant devices may be positioned using the insertion tool . for instance , pedicle screws , clamps for securing a rod to a plate , and other items featuring a rod clamp similar to the illustrated saddle 52 of hook 50 may be inserted and positioned using the insertion tool 10 disclosed herein . the present embodiments are , therefore , to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive , and all changes coming within the meaning and equivalency range of the appended claims are intended to be embraced therein . spatially relative terms such as “ under ”, “ below ”, “ lower ”, “ over ”, “ upper ”, “ distal ”, “ proximal ”, and the like , are used for ease of description to explain the positioning of one element relative to a second element . further , the terms “ down ”, “ downward ”, “ up ”, “ upward ”, and the like , are used to explain the positioning of the elements as viewed in the figures . these terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in addition to different orientations than those depicted in the figures . further , terms such as “ first ”, “ second ”, and the like , are also used to describe various elements , regions , sections , etc and are also not intended to be limiting .
