a method of preventing headache in a human is disclosed which comprises the administration to a human in need thereof of an effective amount of a compound of formula i ## str1 ## wherein r 1 and r 3 are , independently ,    h ,    ch 3 ,    co , or    coar , where ar is optionally substituted phenyl ; r 2 is selected from the group consisting of pyrrolidine , piperidine , and hexamethyleneimino ; or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof .
the current invention is related to the discovery that a select group of 2   aryl benzo [ b ] thiophenes ( the compounds of formula i ) are useful for preventing headaches . general terms used in the description of compounds herein described bear their usual meanings . for example , &# 34 ; c 1   c 6 alkyl &# 34 ; refers to straight or branched aliphatic chains of 1 to 6 carbon atoms including methyl , ethyl , propyl , iso   propyl , n   butyl , pentyl , hexyl and the like . the term &# 34 ; substituted phenyl &# 34 ; refers to a phenyl group alone or having one or more substituents selected from the group consisting of c 1   c 4 alkyl , c 1   c 4 alkoxy , hydroxy , nitro , chloro , fluoro , or tri ( chloro or fluoro ) methyl . &# 34 ; oc 1   c 4 alkyl &# 34 ; refers a c 1   c 4 alkyl group attached through an oxygen bridge such as , methoxy , ethoxy , n   propoxy , iso   propoxy , and the like . the term &# 34 ; pharmaceutically acceptable salt &# 34 ; refers to either acid or base addition salts which are known to be non   toxic and are commonly used in the pharmaceutical literature . commonly used acid addition salts are inorganic salts formed by the addition of sulfuric acid , nitric acid , hydrochloric acid , hydrobromic acid phosphoric acid , phosphorous acid and the like ; or organic salts formed by the addition of acetic acid , formic acid , benzoic acid , citric acid , methanesulfonic acid and the like . commonly used basic addition salts are the salts formed by alkali or alkaline earth hydroxides , ammonium hydroxide , alkyl or aromatic amines and the like . a preferred salt of this invention is the hydrochloride salt . the term &# 34 ; solvate &# 34 ; refers to a molecular complex of a compound of formula i with one or more solvent molecules . such solvent molecules would be those commonly used in the pharmaceutical literature , which are known to be innocuous to the recipient , e . g ., water , ethanol , and the like . the compounds of this invention are derivatives of centrally located carbon , i . e ., the &# 34 ;   co   &# 34 ; moiety in formula i , thus derivatives are methanones , e . g ., a compound of a    co    b , would be named [ a ] [ b ] methanone . further the compounds of formula i are derivatives of benzo [ b ] thiophene which is named and numbered according to the ring index , the american chemical society , as follows : ## str3 ## thus , raloxifene hydrochloride , which is a preferred embodiment of this invention , is a compound of formula i , where r 1 and r 3 are both hydrogen and r 2 is a piperidinyl ring , the hydrochloride salt thereof . raloxifene hydrochloride is named [ 2  ( 4   hydroxyphenyl )  6   hydroxybenzo [ b ] thie   3   yl ][ 4  [ 2  ( 1   piperidenyl ) ethoxy ] phenyl ] methanone hydrochloride . all of the compounds used in the methods and formulations of the current invention can be made according to procedures , such as those detailed in u . s . pat . no . 4 , 133 , 814 and u . s . pat . no . 4 , 418 , 068 , each of which is included by reference , herein . in general , the process starts with a benzo [ b ] thiophene having a 6   hydroxyl group and a 2  ( 4   hydroxylphenyl ) group . the starting compound is protected , alkylated , and de   protected to form the compounds of formula i . the formula i compounds which are carboxylic esters may be prepared by methods described in u . s . pat . no . 5 , 393 , 763 , which included by reference , herein . the compounds of formula i are members of a group of compounds previously known as antiestrogens , but which have selective estrogenic agonist and antagonist pharmacologic activities . for example , formula i compounds act as estrogen agonists in treating pathologic sequelae caused by the cessation of menses in females ( see : draper et al ., &# 34 ; effects of raloxifene ( ly139481 hcl ) on biochemical markers of bone and lipid metabolism in healthy postmenopausal women &# 34 ;, hong kong , fourth int &# 39 ; l . symp . on osteoporosis , mar . 29 , 1993 ;

effective amount &# 34 ; means an amount of compound of the present invention which is capable of preventing headaches in a human , and preferably a post   menopausal women . by &# 34 ; pharmaceutically acceptable formulation &# 34 ; it is meant that the carrier , diluent , solvent , excipients and salt must be compatible with the active ingredient ( a compound of formula i ) of the formulation , and not be deleterious to the recipient thereof . pharmaceutical formulations can be prepared by procedures known in the art . for example , the compounds of this invention can be formulated with common excipients , diluents , or carriers , and formed into tablets , capsules , and the like . examples of excipients , diluents , and carriers that are suitable for such formulations include the following : fillers and extenders such as starch , sugars , mannitol , and silicic derivatives ; binding agents such as carboxymethyl cellulose and other cellulose derivatives , alginates , gelatin , and polyvinyl pyrrolidone ; moisturizing agents such as glycerol ; disintegrating agents such as agar agar , calcium carbonate , and sodium bicarbonate ; agents for retarding dissolution such as paraffin ; resorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds ; surface active agents such as cetyl alcohol , glycerol monostearate ; adsorptive carriers such as kaolin and bentonire ;
