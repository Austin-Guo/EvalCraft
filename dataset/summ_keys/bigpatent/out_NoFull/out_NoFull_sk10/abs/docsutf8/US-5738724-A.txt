with reference first to fig1 there is illustrated a cross sectional view of a conventional blade coater assembly 2 .
the coating is piped to a distribution header 8 and is applied to the web 4 as it passes underneath blade 10 .
blade 10 doctors excess coating off of web 4 to leave a thin coating film 12 , the thickness of which is exaggerated in the drawing .
as paper web 4 passes through the nip , web 4 picks up the coating of film carried on the surface of the metering roll , in a manner analogous to a rotary printing press .
however , regardless of the coating application method used , a blade is employed to scrape off excess coating as shown in fig1 .
adjusting screws 16 may be turned by hand wheels 22 or they may be motorized for automatic control via a conventional computer setup .
preferably , only one positioning rod 124 for every two or three widthwise control zones will be employed in the present invention .
backing bar 123 is not used for profiling purposes , but is made movable only to enable the installation and control range adjustment of different sized profile tubes 116 .
any suitable pneumatic fluid or gas can be used , but air is preferred .
the view of fig3 b also shows chambers 117 being parallelogram shaped and diagonally oriented .
