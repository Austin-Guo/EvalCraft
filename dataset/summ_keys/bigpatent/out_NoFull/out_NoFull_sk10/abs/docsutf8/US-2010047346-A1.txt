examples of such reducing sugars include : the term maillard reaction is well known in the art and is utilized herein as to its standard meaning .
in this aspect of the invention , it is believed that very minor amounts of coordinating metals and / or reducing sugars can be incorporated into the diluent component without adversely effecting tablet performance .
the term also includes within its scope amounts effective to enhance normal physiological function .
preferably , if the administration is not simultaneous , the compounds are administered in a close time proximity to each other .
the percentages of diluent , binder , lubricant and disintegrant provided herein and in the claims are by weight of the tablet .
because of the relatively high percentage of diluent and the amount of direct contact between the diluent and the active compound in the typical pharmaceutical formulation , the interaction of the diluent with the active compound is of particular concern to the formulator .
examples of diluents suitable for general use include : water soluble fillers and water insoluble fillers , such as calcium phosphate ( e .
the diluents that do not contain coordinating metals and diluents that are non reducing sugars are suitable for tablets of the current invention .
tablet formulations of the invention may have a variety of shapes , including diamond , modified capsule , modified oval , and hexagonal , and may optionally have a tilt .
the tablets may be prepared according to methods known in the art , including direct compression , dry granulation , fluid bed granulation , and wet granulation , and the type of excipients used will vary accordingly .
