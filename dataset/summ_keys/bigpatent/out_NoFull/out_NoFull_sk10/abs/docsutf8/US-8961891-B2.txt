although the following detailed description contains many specific details for purposes of illustration , one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that many variations and alterations to the following details are within the scope and spirit of the invention .
accordingly , any exemplary embodiments of the invention described herein are set forth without any loss of generality to , and without imposing limitations thereon , the present invention .
alcohols are generally classified into primary , secondary and tertiary , based upon the number of carbon atoms connected to the carbon atom that bears the hydroxyl group .
ethanol and n propyl alcohol are primary alcohols , and isopropyl alcohol is a secondary alcohol .
in a typical dehydrogenation reaction of alcohol , the alcohol combines with heat in the presence of a suitable catalyst to yield hydrogen gas and either a ketone or an aldehyde .
when the ipa reaches this temperature and is in the presence of an acceptable catalyst , the ipa converts to acetone and hydrogen while also absorbing energy , thereby lowering the temperature .
exemplary catalyst include , for example , an activated metal of rhodium or ruthenium on a support of alumina or activated carbon .
preferred catalyst include ruthenium on carbon and rhodium on alumina , with rhodium on alumina being most preferred .
in one embodiment , a synthesized ruthenium catalyst can be prepared by making an aqueous solution of ruthenium chloride , adding the solution to activated carbon , and then adding sodium borohydride .
in various embodiments of the present invention , the catalyst can be placed inside a heat exchanger , a separate reaction zone , or added with the alcohol at various points within the apparatus .
