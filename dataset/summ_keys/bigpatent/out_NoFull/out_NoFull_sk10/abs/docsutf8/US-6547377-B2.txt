in accordance with an aspect of the invention , an ink supply is described , wherein measures are taken to prevent the ingress of air into the ink supply from the external environment .
moreover , the ink container holds unsaturated ink , which provides the capability of absorbing some quantity of air within the printing system and therefore preventing or reducing the harmful buildup of air bubbles within the system .
in an exemplary embodiment , the chassis member is a unitary element , fabricated of polyethylene by injection molding .
the collapsible bag is typically fabricated of multiple layers including a metalized or other layer providing very low air diffusion .
this air path is illustrated in fig2 a simplified cross sectional view of the chassis 56 .
in accordance with an aspect of the invention , substantial improvements in the supply shelf life and quantity of delivered air to the printhead is achieved by improving the air barrier properties of the chassis .
ultrasonic insertion , spin welding or heat could also be employed to improve the chassis to insert sealing and assembly force .
fig4 illustrates the lower portion of the insert 100 which is inserted into the chassis opening .
circumferential areas 100 a , 100 b of the insert are enlarged relative to the inner diameter of the tapered chassis opening .
lower interference fit region 100 b of the insert engages tightly with the adjacent areas of the chassis to define a primary seal area preventing the passage of ink , and area 100 a provides a secondary seal area .
