with reference now to the drawings , and in particular to fig1 to 8 thereof , a new and improved dental storage apparatus embodying the principles and concepts of the present invention and generally designated by the reference numeral 10 will be described .
more specifically , the dental storage apparatus 10 of the instant invention essentially comprises the unitary housing 11 formed with a housing front wall 12 spaced from a housing rear wall 15 .
a housing first side wall 13 is spaced from a housing second side wall 14 , with a housing floor 16 extending coextensively and orthogonally between the wall structure .
it is noted that the first container tube 18 is mounted to the second side wall 14 .
a second container tube 20 mounted to the first side wall 13 extends from the upper continuous edge 17 a spaced distance from the housing floor 16 , with the second container tube 20 including a dispenser cavity 21 directed therethrough to receive and permit dispensing of a nested stack of drinking cups 22 .
a third container cavity 23 is oriented between housing front wall 12 and a parallel third container partition wall 31 extending orthogonally between the first and second side walls 13 and 14 .
first side wall slot 24 and second side wall slot 25 are arranged in a parallel coextensive relationship between the first and second side walls in a confronting relationship within the third container cavity 23 to slidingly receive a slide wall 47 therewithin , in a manner to be described in more detail below .
a second container lid 26 is mounted above the second container and includes a first handle 26a .
similarly , a third container cavity lid 27 is mounted to the upper continuous edge 17 and includes a second handle 27a , with the second container cavity lid 27 mounted to the upper continuous edge 17 and orthogonally oriented relative to and coextensive with the upper distal end of the third container cavity 23 .
similarly , the second container lid 26 is mounted coextensively to an upper distal end of the second container cavity 21 .
