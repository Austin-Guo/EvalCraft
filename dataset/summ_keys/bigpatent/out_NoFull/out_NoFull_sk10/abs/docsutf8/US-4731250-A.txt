as can be seen from fig1 the arrangement consists of two endless bands 1 which are assumed here to be steel bands but which may also be other , preferably thermally conducting , bands or reinforced plastic bands .
the parts of the steel bands 1 facing one another form a gap 19 and the size of this gap is determined by supporting or guiding surfaces 11 over which the steel bands 1 are conducted .
the arrangement is also provided with a pumping device 5 which in the case shown here is a peristaltic pump , that is to say a pump which by means of periodical contractions forces the pumped object to advance through a duct .
the compression rollers 7 are controlled so that they compress the steel bands 1 with great force against one another which means that the tube 3 will be closed tightly in the compression region 10 .
hence the pumping arrangement 5 functions so that at least one pair of rollers 7 is always in engagement with one another .
the flattened tube 3 filled with pressurized product 6 is now introduced into a heating zone v , where heat is supplied to such an extent that the product is heated to approx .
in the example given here , heat is supplied by providing magnetic induction coils 12 in the supporting elements 11 of the steel bands 1 .
for this reason the supporting elements 11 in the throttling zone 16 should be adjustable so that the gap can be adapted to allow the desired pressure reduction to be obtained .
the said tube 3 filled with liquid 6 can be divided in a known manner into packing containers by means of repeated transverse seals in regions perpendicular to the tube 3 , whereupon the sealed and divided packages can be separated to individual packing units with the help of cuts through the said sealing regions 17 .
the diameter of the tube 3 of circular cross section may in practice be approx .
