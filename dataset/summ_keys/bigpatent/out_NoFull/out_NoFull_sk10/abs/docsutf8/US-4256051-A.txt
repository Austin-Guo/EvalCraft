referring now to the drawings , wherein like reference numerals designate like or corresponding parts throughout the several views , there is shown fig1 and 2 a housing 10 suitably supported .
located within the lower bottom portion of the housing 10 is a supply receptacle , tank or box like structure 15 which has talc or some similar rubber lubricant .
an elevated hopper 16 secured to the top portion of housing 10 contains a supply of talc which is gravity fed to the talc supply receptacle via supply pipe 17 .
the other side of housing 10 has an opening in alignment with the guide rails or guides 24 and 25 to facilitate the discharge of the beads from the housing 10 .
a vertically extending strip or bar 30 which may be an extension of guideway 26 is located at the one end portion of guideway 26 to act as a stop for the dicharged beads 14 .
a suitable pressure switch 52 actuated by a bead 14 rolling down guideway 11 is operative to energize motor 50 momentarily to advance a bead one position through the bead duster apparatus in cooperation with the plural spaced fingers 40 .
a chain 57 is suitably connected to such sprocket 56 and suitably trained about sprockets 58 through 66 and is operative to rotate the rollers 20 through 23 and the bead rings resting thereon for dusting .
in the operation of the described apparatus , the operator on completing the fabrication of a bead from tacky rubber materials , places the bead onto a guideway or ramp 11 such that the bead rolls down the guideway and engages trip switch 52 , which in turn energizes motor 50 .
upon completion of another bead ring by the operator and by placing such bead ring onto guideway 11 , the bead ring rolls down the guideway to actuate the switch 52 on guideway 11 which will actuate motor 50 for another indexing action by chains 37 and 38 which in turn will move the bead ring located between rollers 20 and 21 into position on the second set of rollers 22 and 23 while the new bead ring is deposited on the first set of rollers 20 and 21 .
upon completion of another tack bead ring by the operator and upon placing it on the guideway 11 , such bead will roll down the guideway 11 to actuate switch 52 initiating another indexing action .
