an electrode system to capture bioelectric signals from a subject generally should address various requirements including safety needs , cost , power consumption , performance , ease of use and subject comfort .
however , the relative importance of these factors may be somewhat different in a non clinical application than in a clinical application .
as a result , signal noise becomes more likely , and the analysis of the signals from the electrodes becomes more prone to error .
in general , the lack of training or knowledge of the user can be alleviated by providing a system that automatically determines whether signal quality for individual electrodes is satisfactory , and displays this information to the user .
thus , the display effective acts as a feedback mechanism to inform the inexperienced user of incorrect positioning of the electrodes .
, a mental command to push , pull or manipulate an object in a real or virtual environment .
the application 152 can also respond to input events by modifying an environment , e .
in this implementation the electrode mounts are apertures 130 configured to receive and mount an electrode , e .
digitized samples of the signal captured by each of the scalp sensors can be stored in a data buffer 108 .
, replacing or re hydrating the sensor contact material as it is drying out , in case of conductive felt tip based sensor .
