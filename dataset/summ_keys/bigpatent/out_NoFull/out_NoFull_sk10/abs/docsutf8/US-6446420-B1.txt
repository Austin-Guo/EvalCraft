fig2 is an isometric view of the tobacco plant 10 shown in fig1 showing a known spraying application of plant growth control chemical to the plant 10 .
it should be noted that presently the most effective active ingredient in the market for plant growth regulation is prime + ® which is produced by novartis corp .
the term “ flumetralin ” is the common name for the active ingredient in the commercial product prime + ® and is a plant growth regulator for control of tobacco suckers .
the average reduction in suckers per plant at harvest is sixty two and five tenths percent ( 62 .
those skilled in the art of tobacco sucker control will appreciate such average reductions as acceptable sucker control .
as illustrated in fig1 , and 3 , known systems incorporate a higher rate of prime + ® in the spray volume which leads to an excess of the chemical that runs down the outside of the stalk , contacting suckers directly to control them .
in tobacco sucker control , one of two complex procedural programs are commonly used .
additional treatments are not required later in the season when weather or geographical conditions do not permit continued sucker regrowth .
the present invention allows tobacco growers to extract the tobacco flower and eliminate suckering in one pass over the tobacco field using a mechanical tobacco topper that is preferably fitted with a burch wet blade ® system .
known tobacco sucker control systems inherently require a substantially larger volume of prime + ® because , as previously mentioned above , the known systems require that the effective chemical physically run down the entire length of the tobacco plant , thereby contacting each sucker .
