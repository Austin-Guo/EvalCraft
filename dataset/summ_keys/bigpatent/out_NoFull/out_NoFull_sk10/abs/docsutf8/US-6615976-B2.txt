the truck includes an endless thrower belt 12 , that is attached to the vehicle and is supported by a frame 50 .
the truck includes a drive means ( not shown ) to power the belt so as to move particulate material ( not shown ) deposited onto the belt from the truck bed 14 or from a hopper .
material may be deposited onto the belt directly from the truck bed 14 or an additional conveyor 54 may operate between the truck bed 14 and the belt 12 to transfer the material .
the apparatus includes an endless belt 16 located above the thrower belt 12 and adjacent to the outlet of the truck bed or hopper 14 .
in a preferred embodiment the endless belt 16 is approximately the same width as the thrower belt 12 .
in one embodiment , the endless belt 16 has ribs 30 located on the outer surface thereof and that run transverse to the direction of travel 32 .
when the thrower belt 12 is in motion it drives the endless belt 16 as a result of the frictional engagement between the belts 12 and 16 .
in another embodiment , the endless belt 16 may be smooth while still maintaining the frictional engagement with the thrower belt 12 .
the frictional engagement may result from direct contact between the belts 12 and 16 or indirect contact , where the particulate material that is passing between the belts 12 and 16 transfers the motion from the thrower belt 12 to the endless belt 16 .
the endless belt 16 extends around at least two pairs of wheels 22 rotatably attached to axles 24 mounted on opposite ends of a frame 54 which preferably comprises two longitudinal frame rails 20 extending along the length of endless belt 16 .
