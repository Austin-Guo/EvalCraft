in a similar manner , a further nine body sections 5 are longitudinally arranged between the central body section 3 and the tail 4 , each body section 5 again being pivotally attached to their adjacent segments .
this representation may be applied by engraving , embossing or printing on the top surface of these sections .
in the presently described embodiment , a set of free spinning wheels 6 are located on the bottom surface of the fourth and fifteenth body sections 5 , the central body section 3 and the tail 4 .
these wheels 6 assist the movement of the snake 1 across a surface , as described in further detail below .
the tail 4 also comprises a plurality of beads which rattle during the movement of the snake 1 across a surface , thus further adding to the authenticity of the snake 1 .
it is preferable for the pcb to comprise a receiver 10 such that the snake 1 can be controlled via a remote control unit 11 .
on the bottom surface of the head 2 is located a switch 13 used to connect and disconnect the power source 7 and the motor unit 9 .
the wheels 15 a and 15 b are provided with serrated grips so as to increase the friction between the wheels 15 a and 15 b and the surface over which the snake 1 is to move .
with reference to fig7 there now follows an explanation of how the motor unit 9 acts to move the snake 1 across a surface .
when the switch 13 is in the on position the power source 7 is connected to the motor unit 9 and the snake 1 is ready for use .
