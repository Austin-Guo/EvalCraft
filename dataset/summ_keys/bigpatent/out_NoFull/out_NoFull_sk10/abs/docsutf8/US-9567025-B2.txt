bicycle sharing has been implemented in many towns and cities to support public transportation .
most of these bicycle sharing programs encounter problems related to vandalism , theft , and the high cost of maintenance .
to address these issues , some bicycle sharing programs require the user to leave a deposit or identification to prevent bicycle theft .
attempts to deter theft include the use of bicycles with non removable parts and unique visual appearances , which limit their utility outside of the bicycle sharing program .
recent bicycle sharing programs have attempted to eliminate the need for active management by employing “ smart ” terminals that track the status of rented bicycles .
while current automated systems are an appealing method of bicycle sharing , the system has not been widely implemented due to the high cost of the “ smart ” bicycle terminals .
based on this fact , the initial concept of removing the station was developed .
this is a major issue as many cities creating bike sharing systems require the system to be accessible to all members of the community .
the requirement of a phone to use the system prevents low income members of a community from being able to use the system .
the inventors solve this issue by incorporating an electronic console with an integrated touch screen on the handle bars of the bike .
