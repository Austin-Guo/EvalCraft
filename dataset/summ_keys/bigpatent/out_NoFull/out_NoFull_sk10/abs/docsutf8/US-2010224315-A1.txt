in one embodiment , the adhesive coating 312 comprises a black adhesive that can also serve as a masking feature .
it is further noted that when the tape 100 ( or 200 ) is applied to the rack beam 402 , any pits or pockmarks on the beam are securely covered and hidden by the tape , thereby providing a clean , smooth surface upon which any suitable label ( s ) may be affixed .
the presently disclosed tape systems 100 , 200 allow pressure sensitive labels to be easily removed and replaced on rack beams , shelves , or any other suitable object , as many times as necessary .
such labels can be removed without ripping or tearing .
further , new labels can be applied without fear of previous labels or markings affecting the scan of a bar code .
this allows rack beams and shelves to remain clean and uniform and contain only labels with the most current required data .
as a result , any confusion from numerous labels with conflicting information on the rack beams or shelves is minimized .
moreover , the release topcoat 302 of the tapes 100 , 200 allows any commercially available label to be used , including those with inexpensive permanent pressure sensitive adhesive coatings rather than more expensive removable coatings .
having described the above illustrative embodiments of the presently disclosed system and method of refacing or resurfacing rack beams , shelves , and other such objects , other alternative embodiments or variations may be made .
as shown in fig7 a , the multiple layers of the tape 700 include a transparent laminating film 704 with an adhesive coating 706 on one face thereof , and a silicone release topcoat 702 on the opposite face thereof for supporting replaceable adhesive backed pressure sensitive labels .
