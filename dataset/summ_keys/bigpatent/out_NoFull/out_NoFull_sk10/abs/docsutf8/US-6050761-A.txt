referring to fig1 of the drawings , a shipping container assembly 10 of the invention can be seen having a pair of intermediate support structures 11 and oppositely disposed end cap assemblies 12 .
the honeycomb base pads 13 have a honeycomb center of interconnected cellulose bands 16 on edge between upper and lower encasement paper skins 18 as will be well understood by those skilled in the art .
as such , the base pads 13 provide a raised insulated surface for a load l illustrated in fig7 of the drawings .
the overlying connecting elements 15 are made from a multiple layer of cardboard sheets of longitudinal flute construction having oppositely disposed right angular flaps 19 and 20 each of which is cut inwardly from its respective free ends to define bendable tabs 21 and 22 on each of said flaps .
referring now to fig2 5 of the drawings , it will be seen that to assemble each of the intermediate support structures 11 first a connector element 15 is positioned flange side up on a flat surface .
next the panel base 13 is positioned thereon and pairs of the supporting tubes 14 extend in oppositely disposed relationship between respective free ends of the panel base 13 and upstanding flanges 19 and 20 .
a second connecting element 15 extends over the upstanding free ends of the support tubes 14 interconnecting same about the load l .
the bendable tabs 21 and 22 on each of the flaps 19 and 20 are bent inwardly on each side of the respective support tube pairs 14 stabilizing same therewith .
a panel base 13a of the hereinbefore described honeycomb construction with a pair of oppositely disposed upstanding support panels 17 that act as spacers are formed from fan folding sheets of triple layered cardboard 17a with longitudinal flutes 17b together as best seen in fig9 and 11 of the drawings .
a retaining sleeve 25a is positioned over the sidewalls 27 when they are positioned on the respective ends of the load l .
