embodiments of the invention are directed to vapor liquid contacting apparatuses comprising a primary contacting ( e .
, natural gas comprising predominantly methane ) , the primary absorption zone can achieve the bulk or main removal of these contaminants , while the secondary absorption zone can serve as a “ finishing ” or “ polishing ” zone to more completely purify the impure gas .
the apparatuses and methods of vapor and liquid contacting described herein may be used in any vapor liquid contacting application , and especially offshore applications , for example , when installed on a floating vessel or platform .
in such cases , vapor liquid contacting is susceptible to inefficiencies resulting from horizontal motion of the apparatus ( e .
improved contacting efficiency and associated performance gains are achieved by better protecting the secondary contacting zone against the effects of horizontal movement , in particular by disposing this zone at a height below the primary contacting zone .
, such that they do not require an excessive installation surface on a floating vessel or platform ) .
, primary absorption ) zone if a portion of the secondary contacting zone extends below the bottom of the primary contacting zone or below the point at which an inlet enters the primary contacting zone .
the primary absorption zone 100 is in the form of an upper absorption column and comprises , for example packing material or a plurality of trays to improve the efficiency of vapor liquid contacting in this zone .
otherwise , separate vessels may be used to contain the different absorption zones .
according to various embodiments , the absorption zones may have differing cross sectional areas and / or shapes , or the cross sectional areas and / or shapes may vary over the axial height of one or both absorption zones .
