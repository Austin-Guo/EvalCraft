a series of spaced transverse perforation lines across each of the webs is used to divide the webs into individual cover and base sheets .
the adhesive patterns may comprise continuous or noncontinuous stripes or a series of spots .
other patterns of heat sealable adhesive 38 are applied on the lower half of the back side of base sheet 14 generally parallel to marginal side edges 20b , 22b and bottom end edge 26b .
the window 48 is positioned on cover sheet 12 in any convenient location and is designed to mate with addressee information which has been printed on an interior surface of base sheet 14 so that information can be viewed for mailing purposes .
