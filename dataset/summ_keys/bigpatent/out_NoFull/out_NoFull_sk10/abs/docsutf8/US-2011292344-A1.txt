to provide spectral output selectivity and brightness flexibility , a plurality of color light sources are selectively combined to produce an illuminating light having a desired spectral output .
in this fashion , a clinician may thus not only alter the spectral output for the illumination but also vary ( or keep constant ) the resulting luminous flux despite the spectral augmentation .
each led associates with a corresponding collimating lens .
because of the rgb contribution from the sources , combined light beam 140 may nominally be a white light beam .
to provide spectral variability in addition to white light illumination , the radiant flux ( intensity ) for each light source may be tuned as desired .
for example , constant power sources may drive the leds through pulse width modulators .
in one embodiment , controller 160 automatically adjusts the gain responsive to feedback as sensed through an optical sampler 165 that samples combined beam 140 .
for example , optical sampler 165 may comprise a beam splitter or a folding mirror to split off a relatively small portion of the combined beam 140 as a sampled beam 170 .
the remaining unsampled portion of combined beam 140 is received by a condensing optic lens 180 so as to couple into an optic fiber 185 ( or optic fiber bundle ) .
controller 160 is also responsive to user input such that a physician may manually command the appropriate gains so as to achieve the desired spectral content for combined beam 140 .
