this description of preferred embodiments is intended to be read in connection with the accompanying drawings , which are to be considered part of the entire written description of this invention .
the drawing figures are not necessarily to scale and certain features of the invention may be shown exaggerated in scale or in somewhat schematic form in the interest of clarity and conciseness .
should be construed to refer to the orientation as then described or as shown in the drawing figure under discussion .
these relative terms are for convenience of description and normally are not intended to require a particular orientation .
terms concerning attachments , coupling and the like , such as “ connected ” and “ interconnected , ” refer to a relationship wherein structures are secured or attached to one another either directly or indirectly through intervening structures , as well as both movable or rigid attachments or relationships , unless expressly described otherwise .
in the claims , means plus function clauses are intended to cover the structures described , suggested , or rendered obvious by the written description or drawings for performing the recited function , including not only structural equivalents but also equivalent structures .
very often fiber 7 is in the form of metal wire , however , other nonmetal fibers may also be used in connection with the present invention .
a magnetic particle brake 37 is positioned adjacent to the rear surface of spindle assembly support plate 33 in engaged , controlling relation to second end 35 of spindle 21 .
magnetic particle brake 37 provides means for the controlled retarding of the pay out of fiber 7 from bulk supply spool 9 , as will hereinafter be disclosed in further detail .
it will be understood that a conventional magnetic particle brake 37 of the type suitable for use with the present invention will comprise a rotor that is contained within a brake housing body and attached to end 35 of spindle 21 .
