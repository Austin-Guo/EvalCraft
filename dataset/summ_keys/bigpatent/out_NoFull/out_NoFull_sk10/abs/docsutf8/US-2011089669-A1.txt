referring to the drawings , and more particularly to fig1 , a trailer hitch system in accordance with the present disclosure is generally shown at 10 .
the hitch frame 11 is secured at opposed ends to a frame of a car .
for simplicity purposes , the connector ends of the hitch frame 11 are not illustrated , but may be of any configuration as a function of the vehicle to which they are secured .
the hitch frame 11 may have any shape so as to be secured to the vehicle .
the receiver 12 accommodates an end of a connector mount .
other types of connectors may be used as alternatives to the hitch ball 23 with the mount unit 20 .
a pair of openings 26 are also defined in the member 21 , so as to allow radial movement of abutments with respect to the member 21 , as will be described hereinafter .
other actuation configurations are considered in alternatives to the threading engagement to actuate the translation movement of the wedge bar 30 in the member 21 , such as pistons , levers , two bar linkages or the like .
therefore , a translation of the wedge bar 30 with respect to the member 21 will cause a radial projection or retraction of the abutments 33 as a result of the sliding engagement of the abutments 33 on the wedge surfaces 32 .
now that the various components of the trailer hitch system 10 have been described , a method for using the trailer hitch system is set forth .
