the spaces between partition plates , such as plates 26 , 28 , provide cavities into which wet cement is compressed and thereafter stripped therefrom to form a molded concrete product .
an alignment pin , such as pin 58 shown in fig2 is mounted on the end bracket at each corner portion and an alignment bore , such as bore 60 , coaxial with the pin , is formed on the side beam .
the bores are sized and positioned so that , when each bore has its associated alignment pin therein , the mold box support frame is sufficiently aligned to form molded products , all as more fully described in my u .
the other retractor , not visible in the drawings , is located at the opposite end of mold box assembly 10 and is substantially identical to retractor 90 .
retractor 90 further includes an associated bolt 98 , which is threaded adjacent its end so as to engage spacer 66 when the bolt is fully extended through the bores .
the end bracket is then fixedly mounted on the ends of the frame side beams .
so positioned , the spacers are flushly received in the slots in the box mounting brackets and the mold is ready to be filled with wet cement material .
it can thus be seen that the structure and method provided by the present invention produces important advantages .
first , the vertical vibration forces imparted to mold box assembly 10 during operation are distributed over a relatively larger area .
when bolts are used , as in prior art adapters , only the heads of the bolt resist upward forces imparted to the mold box .
