the percentage loading of each metal was varied in the test samples to investigate the effects of the actual amount and the ratio of the different metals on the substrate .
the catalyst samples were subjected to different tests to determine the activities of the catalysts .
the conditions of testing ranged in temperature and pressure under vapour phase or trickle bed mode .
