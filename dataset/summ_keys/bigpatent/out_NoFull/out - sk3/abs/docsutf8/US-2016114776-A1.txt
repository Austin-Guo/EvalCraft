referring now to the drawings , wherein like reference numerals refer to like parts throughout , there is seen in fig1 a first embodiment of a brake cylinder maintaining valve 10 that integrates a quick service limiting valve and a bcm reference pressure charging check valve into a single unitary structure that cooperates to provide all of the relevant functions with more precise control that otherwise possible .
nozzle 14 extends along a longitudinal axis through a brake cylinder pressure chamber 20 in an upper portion of a bushing 22 and through a narrow passageway 24 that separates brake cylinder pressure chamber 20 from a quick service pressure chamber 26 defined in a lower portion of bushing 22 .
it should be recognized that the various chambers are in communication with the corresponding elements of a conventional braking system such that the pressure in a particular chamber reflects the pressure in the corresponding element of the braking system .
