the spherical building block of the present invention is derived from a cube and is , itself , the product of a plurality of squares folded and assembled to form the individual subunits that are joined together to form the intersecting rings .
to permit eight of the subunits 4 to combine to form a ring 9 , the fitting angles 6 have to be adjusted to an external angle of 45 degrees , which obliges the exterior lid or upper surface 7 to adopt a semispherical curvature while the interior lid or lower surface 8 remains flat .
this procedure is so simple since the nature of the square contains in its proportion the capacity to form spheres , or substantially spherical bodies 1 .
