as can be seen from fig1 the arrangement consists of two endless bands 1 which are assumed here to be steel bands but which may also be other , preferably thermally conducting , bands or reinforced plastic bands .
the parts of the steel bands 1 facing one another form a gap 19 and the size of this gap is determined by supporting or guiding surfaces 11 over which the steel bands 1 are conducted .
the arrangement is also provided with a pumping device 5 which in the case shown here is a peristaltic pump , that is to say a pump which by means of periodical contractions forces the pumped object to advance through a duct .
