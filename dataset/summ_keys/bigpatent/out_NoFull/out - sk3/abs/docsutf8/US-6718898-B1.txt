the assemblies 4 , 6 and 8 are generally similar in that each provides a controlled , resilient resistance to reciprocating movement of a piston that responds to forces in excess of a threshold force and over a flexion range of a contained resilient member and / or material .
the assembly 4 includes a spring that biases movement of the piston and is shown in greater detail in the exploded assembly drawing of fig2 .
either of the assemblies 4 or 6 may also be constructed with a closed hydraulic or pneumatic chamber that provides a resilient reciprocating motion to a contained piston .
