referring initially to fig1 , there is illustrated a system 10 constructed according to one preferred embodiment of the invention .
at this location , the fluid enters the vertical flow tube 18 and proceeds upwardly along the spiral path defined by spiral baffle 24 .
the spiral shaped path of baffle 24 tends to separate the gas slugs 26 from the liquid medium by centrifugal forces imposed on the liquid , which forces cause the liquid portion to migrate radially outwardly from the center of baffle 24 , as the mix rises and increases in velocity .
