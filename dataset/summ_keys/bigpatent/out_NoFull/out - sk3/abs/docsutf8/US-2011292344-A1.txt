to provide spectral output selectivity and brightness flexibility , a plurality of color light sources are selectively combined to produce an illuminating light having a desired spectral output .
in this fashion , a clinician may thus not only alter the spectral output for the illumination but also vary ( or keep constant ) the resulting luminous flux despite the spectral augmentation .
each led associates with a corresponding collimating lens .
