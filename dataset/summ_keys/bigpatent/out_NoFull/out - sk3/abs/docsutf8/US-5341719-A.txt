the jacket / liner portions are formed from a tubular coextrusion cylinder of concentric material layers carefully selected to include compatible materials , such as nickel , iron and cobalt base superalloys .
the boreliner portion 20 can be fabricated of a more expensive high density refractory metal alloy which can withstand the very high breech temperature .
25720 ) with an inco in 909 iron based alloy jacket 16 surrounding and metallurgically joined to an inco in 718 nickel based alloy liner 18 , with both the inside and outside of the tube being formed within one coextrusion die , to provide a high degree of concentricity of the interface diameter d i to both the liner bore surface 18c and the od of the jacket portion 16 .
