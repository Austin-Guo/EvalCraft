embodiments of this invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings .
knitting yarns for forming the pile loops 4 may be monofilament yarns as shown in fig1 or multifilament yarns as shown in fig2 when knitting the female type surface fastener cloth .
on the other hand , when knitting the male type surface fastener cloth , pile loops are knitted using monofilament yarns as shown in fig3 whereupon the pile loops 4 are cut on side near top to form hooks 6 .
the back side of the cloth , as shown in fig2 and 3 , is provided with coating treatment such as with synthetic rubber or resin in order to prevent the pile loops 4 and the hooks 6 from being removed and to give the knitted structure a shape keeping characteristic .
fig4 is a design diagram showing the cloth of this invention , and fig5 is a design diagram showing various kinds of yarns .
the cloth is knitted on a double russell knitting machine equipped with two rows of needle threads .
the inlaid yarns l3 , l4 are interlaced with the knitting yarns l1 together with the foundation yarns l2 in and along the wales by the front needle and the inlaid yarns l3 , l4 are laid in the courses in opposite directions and extend over a range of one to three wales for every course , thus forming squared meshes 5 .
therefore , though ill the presence of the meshes 5 , the knitted cloth is stable both in warp and weft directions ; the inlaid yarns l3 and l4 together with the foundation yarns l2 are tightly interlaced with the base of the individual pile loop 4 to keep the pile loop 4 standing in a safe state as shown in fig6 thus increasing the engaging force .
