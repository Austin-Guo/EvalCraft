in order to provide a better understanding of the production process according to the present invention , it will be referred to the prior art .
according to the prior art , cotton fiber is a vegetable natural fiber and can not form stable bonds by reacting with vegetable dyes .
in order to eliminate this drawback , the so called rem technique is carried out prior to vegetable dyeing process .
the process step designated as rem or “ r ” , allows to increase the distance ( gap ) between the fibers and to provide a catalyst effect in the binding reaction between the dye molecules and the cotton molecules so that the dyeing efficiency is increased at least three fold .
the development of this technique , in turn , paved the way to use vegetable dyes in mass production with competitive costs and qualities .
here below , both the process steps , and the raw materials ( or materials ) used in the process will be referred to with abbreviations .
using this rem technique ( r ) , it is now possible to carry out industrial production in a continuous system in reduced time intervals and at lower temperatures .
thus , it is further possible to provide textile products in original natural plant colors and luster , as desired , without using any auxiliary chemicals .
