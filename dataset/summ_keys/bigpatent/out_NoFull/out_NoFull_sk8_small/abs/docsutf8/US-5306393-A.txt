while a dryer fabric is shown it should be understood that the harness of the present invention can be used to install other seamed fabrics and belts , such as a seamed press felt , on a paper machine .
a fabric body 12 shipped to a paper mill has a removable standard leader 14 which includes steel bar 18 .
while fig1 illustrates five grommets 16a 16e , it should be recognized that more or less grommets may be used and there may be an even or odd number of grommets .
the grommets may be brass or other materials well known in the art for such a use .
the materials used for ring 22 include steel or other material known in the art for such a use .
while ring 22 is illustrated as being circular , it should be recognized that ring 22 can be any shape or it may be any line receiving device which can slidably receive a line and which will permit rope 20 to slide so that loading harness 10 can be self aligning .
rope 20 can be a rope made of any material , such as nylon , polyester , or polyethylene , which has sufficient strength to pull the fabric body onto the machine .
the rope should also be a material that is not likely to damage the fabric when the harness is connected to and shipped with the fabric body and whose weight minimizes concerns of seam burnout .
