the object of the invention is to provide a thermally bonded nonwoven fabric having improved thermal stability properties , in particular the shrinkage tendency of the nonwoven fabrics obtained .
in addition , the chemical stability is increased compared to fibers containing copolymers of monomer mixtures such as isophthalic acid / terephthalic acid .
the object is achieved according to the invention by use of a thermoplastically bonded nonwoven fabric containing a low shrinkage dual component core sheath fiber .
the low shrinkage dual component core sheath fiber is composed of a crystalline polyester core and a crystalline polyester sheath which has a melting point at least 10 Â° c .
the sheath of the low shrinkage dual component fiber is preferably composed of a homogeneous polyester polymer , produced from a monomer pair , of which greater than 95 % is formed from a single polymer pair .
the nonwoven fabric according to the invention may contain additional fibers besides the low shrinkage dual component core sheath fiber , depending on the particular use .
the method for producing the thermally bonded nonwoven fabric is characterized in that the fibers are laid out to produce a nonwoven fabric , thermally bonded , and immediately compressed if necessary .
in the method , the fibers of the nonwoven fabric according to the invention are placed in a thermal fusion oven which allows uniform temperature equilibration of the binding fibers .
