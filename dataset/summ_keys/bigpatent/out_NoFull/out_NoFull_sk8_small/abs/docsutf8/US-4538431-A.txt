making initial reference to fig1 a circular knitting machine according to this invention , which may be either of the single or double cylinder type , comprises at least two yarn feeds f , one only of which is shown in the drawings for convenience of illustration , and at least one pattern selection device 1 , in particular of the type including a pattern drum and selection slides , in the drawing only the selection slides 2 being shown .
the butts 9 are adapted to follow , in a manner known per se , the profile of a ring cam 11 formed with substantially triangular raised portions 12 at the yarn feeds f .
as is known , the raised portions 12 are only climbed by those jacks which have been selected to bring their respective needles 4 to knit , i .
those jacks 3 whose butts 8 are not subjected to the action of a respective slide 2 urged radially toward the cylinder 6 by the program set on the related pattern drum .
the jacks 3 , whose butts 8 are instead interfering with a respective slide 2 moving toward the cylinder 6 , are urged into the respective groove 5 of the cylinder 6 with a tilting movement , to move to the inside of the raised portions 12 with their lower ends in contact with an inner or inboard surface 13 of the ring cam 11 , thereby the associated needles 4 are not made to knit .
in accordance with this invention , at at least one of the raised portions 12 , on the inner or inboard side thereof , there is arranged a guiding cam 17 , adapted to bring and hold radially to the inside the lower ends of the jacks 3 selected not to follow the raised portion 12 .
the guiding cam 17 extends circumferentially at least as far as the proximity of the following raised portion 12 and is so configured as not to affect the jacks 3 which follow the profile of the ring cam 11 .
those selected to stay low and not bring their respective needles 4 to knit , are prevented from climbing the following raised portion 12 , and remain accordingly inoperative also at the corresponding yarn feed .
