the process of the present invention provides a process for an economical , simple and efficient process for fractionating in high yield and high purity , a wide variety of renewable lignocellulosic plant material to its major polymeric components cellulose , lignin and hemicellulose , which can then be used as raw materials for production of chemicals , plastics , polymers , etc .
the process of this invention is significantly different in methodology and the consequent results achieved , as represented in other patents on the subject .
wo 2000019004 a1 describes steam explosion of fibrous material like bagasse for producing bleached paper .
this is very different in process condition as well material quality obtained .
in the current invention , steam is passed in neutral ph and the quality of pulp is suitable for making cellulose plastics like cellulose acetate .
in the current invention , the steam explosion is used for separating the hemicellulose from the cellulose and lignin components , and the later is later isolated by alkali treatment , leading to a quality of pulp which is suitable for making cellulose plastics like cellulose acetate after the bleaching step .
the hemicellulose produced by the said process using the said biomass material has an yield of 19 26 % based on the weight of the bagasse used .
the lignin produced by the said process using the said biomass material has an yield of 15 16 % based on the weight of the bagasse used .
