each warp yarn passes trough a eyelet 3a of a heddle 3 in order to open the thread to allow the passage of a thread to form the fabric that rolls up around a winding beam or drum .
in the example shown , it is assumed that there are only two heddles 3 or two groups of heddles , one in an upper position and the other in a lower position .
the lower extremity of each heddle is connected to the frame of the loom by a tension spring 5 , while the upper extremity is firmly attached to a guide 6 .
as can be seen more clearly in fig2 the shed forming mechanism comprises a funicular element 8 of which each of its ends is provided with a catch or hook 9 .
the hooks comprise a lateral lip 9a which interacts with slays or knives 10 actuated in a reciprocating motion in opposition to one another .
the funicular element 8 passes around a first pulley 11 of a cross piece 12 which has a second pulley 13 which is encircled by one of the guides 6 .
the opposite extremity of the guide that is connected to the heddle 3 is anchored at a fixed point 14 of the frame of the machine .
the upper part of the mechanism 7 is provided with retaining catches or pivotable hooks designed in the form of levers 15 and being part of a selector device .
