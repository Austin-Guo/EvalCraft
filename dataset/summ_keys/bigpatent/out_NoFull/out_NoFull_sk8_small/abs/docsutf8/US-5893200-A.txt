the stitch base 2 has a convex curvature in a direction of web movement , and a tensile stress is applied onto the web 1 between a feed roller 6 and a discharge roller 7 , which for this purpose is driven at a larger peripheral speed than the feed roller 6 .
as shown in fig2 the stitch base 2 consists of a base plate 8 with blades 9 extending tranversely to the direction of web movement , and having end faces defining a continuously curved enveloping surface to constitute a web support .
the web 1 is therefore drawn over the blades 9 in the form of a traverse , and the wider edge blades 9a constitute a deflection guide with the effect that due to this deflection the web 1 lies flat against the stitch base 2 both in the inlet area and in the outlet area .
as a result of the tensile stress acting on the web 1 between the feed roller 6 and the discharge roller 7 there is produced a pressure urging the web 1 against the blades 9 to the convex stitch base 2 , so that the occurring normal forces act against the resistance to a withdrawal of the needles 5 from the web 1 .
despite these normal forces , in particular in the case of a high distribution density of the needles 5 , which impinge between the individual blades 9 in several needle rows , the web 1 may be lifted off the blades 9 above all in the middle portion of the stitch base 2 , which impairs the needling result , in particular when only comparatively small tensile stresses should be applied onto the web 1 .
stripper blades 11 may likewise be associated with the edge blades 9a , to ensure a particularly good guidance of the web in the needling area .
these stripper blades 11 do , however , not prevent the desired high needle distribution density , because they do not protrude into the needle path of the needle rows between the individual blades 9 .
the attachment of the stripper blades 11 can easily be effected by means of cheeks 12 , which are mounted vertically adjustable on the lateral end faces of the base plate 8 of the stitch base 2 .
