fig1 shows an upper roller of a belt stretching mechanism , which is formed in accordance with the present invention .
the sleeve 17 for an optimal pressing force has a radial gap 18 which can be more clearly seen in the drive belt 20 shown in fig2 .
it can be adjusted by a radial gap 18 relative to the axial projections 15 and 16 automatically to the thickness of the fiber bundle .
in particular it is achieved in that it performs a deviating movement toward the belt guide 21 in this position the sleeve 17 runs around the belt 20 and the parts 11 and 12 without wear .
it will be understood that each of the elements described above , or two or more together , may also find a useful application in other types of constructions differing from the types described above .
while the invention has been illustrated and described as embodied in roller for belt stretching mechanism , it is not intended to be limited to the details shown , since various modifications and structural changes may be made without departing in any way from the spirit of the present invention .
without further analysis , the foregoing will so fully reveal the gist of the present invention that others can , by applying current knowledge , readily adapt it for various applications without omitting features that , from the standpoint of prior art , fairly constitute essential characteristics of the generic or specific aspects of this invention .
what is claimed as new and desired to be protected by letters patent is set forth in the appended claims .
