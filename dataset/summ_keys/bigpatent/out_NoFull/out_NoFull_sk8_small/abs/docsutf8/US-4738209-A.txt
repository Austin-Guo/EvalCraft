reference will now be made in detail to the present preferred embodiment of the invention , an example of which is illustrated in the accompanying drawings in which like reference characters refer to corresponding elements .
a needle bar 6 having a needle 5 is vertically movably supported at the lower end of the machine arm 2 and vertically moved as a main machine shaft ( not shown ) rotates .
the needle 5 and a thread ring seizing device ( not shown ) constitute a seam forming device and , when both of them are actuated as the main machine shaft rotates , a seam is formed in the work material .
a machine motor 7 for driving rotatably the main machine shaft is fitted to the under surface of the machine table 1 and the rotation thereof is transmitted to the main machine shaft through a known rotation transmitting mechanism including a drive pulley 8 fitted to the wedge of the main machine shaft .
while the work material is held between the holding frame 9 and the pallet 10 , the work material holder 11 is longitudinally reciprocated by the first pulse motor 12 within the horizontal plane , and reciprocated by the second pulse motor 13 in the transverse direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction .
as shown in fig1 an on / off switch 15 for supplying power to the machine is arranged on the lower portion of the front of the machine table 1 and a foot starting switch 17 for starting the machine as well as a foot switch 16 for actuating the holding frame actuating solenoid 14 are arranged under the machine table 1 .
there is also arranged a programming device 18 on the upper right hand surface of the machine table which is used for preparing sewing data , such as data needed to actuate the pulse motor 12 or 13 , for a desired pattern to be sewn and driving data for the machine motor .
a thin platelike ic card 21 is insertable therein , the ic card is used to store the sewing data to be read or written .
