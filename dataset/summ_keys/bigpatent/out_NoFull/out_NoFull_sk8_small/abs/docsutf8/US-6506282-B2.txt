a wide variety of cellulosic fibers can be employed in the process of the present invention .
it is also possible to use mixtures of one or more kinds of cellulosic fibers .
as used herein , the term “ fiber ” or “ fibrous ” is meant to refer to a particulate material wherein the length to diameter ratio of such particulate material is 10 or greater .
it is possible to treat the fiber surfaces by an appropriate method to render them more or less wettable .
the current process , then , is in contrast to known steam explosion processes that generally treat cellulosic fibers that are typically in the form of virgin wood chips or the like .
thus , the current process is a post pulping , or post deinking , cellulosic fiber modifying process as compared to known steam explosion processes that are generally used for high yield pulp manufacturing or waste recycle processes .
such pulping processes generally leave the resulting cellulosic fibers with high levels of lignin .
in general , the cellulosic fibers may be treated with chemicals in either a dry or a wet state .
