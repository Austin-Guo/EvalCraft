a chain stitch sewing machine having an in line looper system is indicated generally at 10 in fig1 .
the needles 25 descend from a top to a bottom position through oblong openings in a foot 28 supported by head 20 and a needle plate 29 supported on bed plate 14 .
a u shaped slide assembly 32 is mounted on base 12 and opens against the sewing direction toward arrow 30 .
a stationary blade 34 is mounted on the closed end of slide assembly 32 and has a cutting edge facing the edge of needle plate 30 .
a knife support bracket 36 is slidably mounted within assembly 32 and carries ten arrow shaped knives 38 which move coaxially with the sewing direction between a retracted position as shown and an extended position in which bracket 36 is moved against the closed end of slider assembly 32 as indicated by a bidirectional arrow 39 .
air cylinder 56 moves support block 48 in a direction transverse to the sewing direction as indicated by a bidirectional arrow 58 and rotates actuator arm 40 as indicated by bidirectional arrow 60 to move knives 38 between the retracted and extended positions .
a spreader support shaft 70 is actuated by a mechanism 72 to move in a direction transverse to the sewing direction as indicated by an arrow 73 and carries ten spreaders 74 , each one cooperating with a corresponding looper 64 to form the type 401 stitch in the conventional fashion .
referring in more detail to fig3 each knife 38 slides between stationary blade 34 and a leaf spring 76 which is supported by the front portion of u shaped slide assembly 32 .
