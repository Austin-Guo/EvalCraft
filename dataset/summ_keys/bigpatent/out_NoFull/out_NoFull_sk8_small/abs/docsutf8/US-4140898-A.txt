describing now the drawings , the circuit 10 illustrated by way of example in fig1 is coupled with a probe or sensor 11 which , here for the sake of simplicity , has been illustrated as a plate capacitor having a grounded plate 12 and a plate 13 having a floating potential .
the probe or sensor 11 is operatively associated for instance with a suction channel 14 of a not particularly illustrated textile machine , which may be for example a preparatory spinning machine or roving frame .
in the channel 14 there are sucked off in the direction of the arrow 15 & # 39 ; , for instance fiber flocks , lumps or yarn or thread rupture pieces , in other words such finite textile structures which are an indication of disturbances in the yarn travel at the textile machine , such as for instance rupture of the yarn or slubbing .
since this finite textile structure has a dielectric constant differing from that of air , during its movement past the probe 11 there is produced a transient potential change at the plate 13 .
also other conditions , such as for instance sucked up dust , fiber fly or climatic changes in the room where there is housed the relevant textile machine , produce a potential change at the plate 13 .
therefore , it is necessary to analyse the superimposed signals , so that there are only evaluated those signals which are predicated upon disturbances which should be detected .
the plate 13 is coupled by means of a screened cable 15 and a protective resistor 16 with discriminator stages generally designated in their entirety by reference character 17 , and the purpose of which is to supress or eliminate potential changes which are not predicated upon operational disturbances and to process the remaining potential changes into a digital evaluatable form .
the impedance converter 21 is an operational amplifier in an electrometer circuit which converts the high ohm voltage fluctuations into low ohm current fluctuations without any appreciable voltage amplification .
