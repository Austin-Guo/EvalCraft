the course of warps extends in the downward direction while the course of wefts extends from the right to the left .
white fields are weft fibers shown in the front view .
as can be seen all three figures of the drawings show floating warp fibers and floating weft wires whereby the weft wire operate as 4 tie units and the warp wires are uniformly tied up into four wire units in the region of the pattern .
this is only one example of the filter cloth , and it is understandable that other ties and connections between the warps and wefts are possible .
a uniform structure of the wefts as shown in the drawings , is not , however interrupted by intermediate or alternating wefts which lie in the middle area between two patterns of each weave design .
the tying of the warps is merely changed in this intermediate region .
it has been known when the same filter cloth is to be always manufactured the discontimity of the wale or seam must be positioned in the direction of warp wires .
since , however in each case during the manufacture of the filter cloths a great variability in a mesh size is desired the discontinuity of the seam is positioned in the direction of the wefts .
