the articles of clothing 14 are transported through the tunnel finisher in a manner oriented transversely with respect to the transporting direction 13 .
the transporting chain of the chain conveyor has supporting hooks .
in the exemplary embodiment shown , all three modules 17 are of approximately identical design , above all are equal in length .
each module 17 is divided by a vertical partition 18 running longitudinally with respect to the transporting direction 13 into a treatment chamber section 24 forming part of the treatment chamber 10 and into an air guiding chamber 19 situated next to it .
from hot air warmed or heated by a heat source , a ventilator 23 in the air guiding chamber 19 produces a hot air flow which passes from above into the treatment chamber 10 , namely the treatment chamber section 24 , of the particular module 17 .
as a result , a hot air flow ( transverse air flow ) which is directed from the top downwards and runs transversely with respect to the transporting direction 13 is produced in the treatment chamber section 24 of the particular module 17 .
a respective vertical partition 25 which runs transversely with respect to the transporting direction 13 is situated between the air guiding chambers 19 of adjacent modules 17 .
at least some partitions 25 between the modules 17 also end at a small distance above the floor 20 of the tunnel finisher in order to form a slot 26 between consecutive air guiding chambers 19 .
