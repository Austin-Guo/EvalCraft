as shown in schematic form in fig1 the jet dyeing apparatus comprises a housing h which includes a liquid treatment chamber or j box 10 in the lower portion of the housing and a fabric transport tube 11 in the housing above the liquid treatment chamber .
in use , the fabric 1 enters the fabric transport tube 11 with the assistance of a driven rotating cylinder 2 as is customary in jet dyeing apparatuses of this general type .
the fabric enters the fabric transport tube 11 at a fabric inlet or entry end 16 and is immediately contacted with liquor from a jet apparatus or peripheral liquor sprayer 3 which is supplied with liquor from a common supply or header 12 .
the preferred peripheral liquor sprayer sprays liquor on the fabric in a manner which both dyes the fabric and which also serves to transport the fabric 1 , which is typically in continuous rope form , along the longitudinal direction of the fabric transport tube 11 and ultimately to the plaiter mechanism 7 .
in accordance with the present invention , the fabric transport tube 11 preferably includes a plurality of peripheral liquor sprayers including the first aforementioned sprayer 3 at the inlet or entry end 16 to the fabric transport tube 11 and a second peripheral liquor sprayer 4 .
in accordance with the preferred arrangement shown in fig3 the second peripheral liquor sprayer 4 is preferably positioned downstream of the first peripheral liquor sprayer 3 and closely adjacent the midpoint 20 of the fabric transport tube 11 .
in this manner , the fabric transport tube 11 will be flooded with dye liquor to improve the liquor fabric interchange within the fabric transport tube , but without significantly impeding the progress of the fabric through the transport tube .
in addition , this design creates a slight turbulence which tends to rearrange the fabric folds leaving the first transport zone prior to treatment in the second peripheral liquor sprayer 4 .
