referring now to the accompanying drawings , one preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described as follows .
as shown in fig1 and the like , a shirts press of the present invention is constructed such that the same comprises a collar iron buck 2 on which a collar 1 a of a shirts 1 is mounted while being expanded ; and a press 3 for depressing against the upper surface of the collar iron buck 2 to press the collar 1 a into its finished state .
an iron surface of the press 3 is formed into a flat surface .
in addition , an upper surface position 2 a of the collar iron buck 2 corresponding to the central part of the collar 1 a in its longitudinal direction is formed into an inverse triangular shape as seen from its front elevational view .
then , the right and left positions 2 b corresponding to both ends of the collar 1 a in its longitudinal direction communicating with the upper surface position 2 a are formed into a horizontal surface .
reference numeral 4 denotes a coil spring for pulling down the cloth cover 2 d and applying a tension to it .
in the present invention , the upper surface of the collar iron buck 2 is formed such that it can be fallen into a flat surface when it is depressed by the press iron 3 .
as shown in fig6 to 11 , the upper surface position 2 a of the collar iron buck 2 is set such that a pair of right and left plates 5 are rotatably connected by a pivot shaft 6 and formed into an inverse triangular shape as seen from its front elevational view .
