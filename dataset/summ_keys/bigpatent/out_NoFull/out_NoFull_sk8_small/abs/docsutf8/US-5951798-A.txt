in preferred embodiments of the present invention , the following textile webs , which have a high standing fiber portion can be used .
the names used to describe the following materials are generally used in german technical journals to refer to same , and may under certain circumstances be trademarks of the respective manufacturers : a ) dilourized needle punched nonwoven material : in this case , the top or standing side , which is generally made to be facing the covering material , consists of pile fibers which , in a velour type manner , project vertically from the needle punched nonwoven material .
the bottom side of this material is formed by a flat random fiber layer of a medium fiber bonding .
based on a voluminous , transversely oriented nonwoven fiber , this nonwoven fiber is first mechanically bonded by punching it through the bottom material with a barbed needle .
then , fiber portions are punched out of the bottom material toward one side by punching through with special needles resulting in a structure on the corresponding side of vertical pile fibers .
in this case , the basis is also a transversely oriented nonwoven fiber , wherein portions of the nonwoven fibers are first shaped into fiber loops .
then other portions of the nonwoven fibers are pushed out through the material by punching with special needles and a vertical fiber pile is formed on the corresponding side of the nonwoven material .
c ) kunit nonwoven knit type material : a voluminous nonwoven material whose top or standing side consists of vertical pile fiber folds and whose bottom side consists entirely of fiber loops .
