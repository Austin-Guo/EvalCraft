a representative construction designed to carry out the invention will be hereinafter described , together with other features thereof .
fibers of the carded web are then oriented predominately in a cross direction as by the action of a cross lapper b .
the cross lapped web is subsequently needlepunched , preferably by suitable needle punching apparatus c .
the block diagram of fig1 generally illustrates schematically the method of making the nonwoven fabric .
the primary fibers ; namely , polyester and lyocell in the form of bales as they are received from the manufacturer are subjected to a standard opener apparatus at 10 .
each type of fibrous bale is fed to its own opener apparatus at 10 .
the fibrous materials having been subjected to the standard type opener apparatus in the industry are then blended at blending stage 11 , utilizing standard apparatus known in the trade .
the resulting fibrous mass 12 is then conveyed to and subjected to the action of one or more standard carding machines a from whence the resulting fibrous web passes to a standard cross lapper b .
