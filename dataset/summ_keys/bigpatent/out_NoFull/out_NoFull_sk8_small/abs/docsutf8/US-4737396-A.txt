with reference to the drawings wherein reference numerals are used to indicate correspondingly numbered elements in the written description , there can be seen a fused composite fabric indicated generally by 10 .
the weft yarn may be spun yarn , multifilament yarn or monofilament yarn , depending upon the specific application of the interlining fabric .
the stitch yarn 13 forms a plurality of side by side walewise extending stitch loop chains 14 on the front or face side of the composite fusible interlining fabric .
a coating of thermoactive adhesive material is illustrated as being applied to the side of the composite interlining fabric containing the inlaid weft yarns 12 .
the coating of thermoactive adhesive material may be applied in any desired manner , such as the randomly arranged dots 16 of the adhesive material shown in fig1 .
in the actual fabric , the dots of adhesive material are substantially invisible .
the adhesive not only bonds the interlining fabric to the garment fabric , but also secures the weft yarns to the interlining fabric itself .
in the absence of such adhesive , the weft yarns have a strong tendency to pull out from under the stitch yarn of the interlining fabric construction .
