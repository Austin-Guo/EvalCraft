thus the restraining means consisting in this case of clip element 26 is prevented from slippage and displacement towards the inner ring 14 .
this manipulation has resulted in a decreasing or diminishing of the effective circumference of the inner ring 14 , so that its effective perimetral dimension has been diminished , and so that the inner ring 14 is now smaller , and out of the groove 12 , and is no longer contiguous with the outer ring 10 .
the expansion of the inner ring 14 into the groove 12 and against the outer ring 10 effectively grips the emplaced cloth or the like , so that it is tautly stretched and may be worked , e .
as shown , the cloth portion 54 extends flatly across the plane defined by the rings 10 and 14 , and is firmly and flatly stretched and held in place for working .
the present device and article of manufacture , in addition to usage as a spring type embroidery hoop or knitting ring , is also eminently suitable for usage in schifling or other sewing machine work , or as a frame if so desired by using a hanging device .
the present device and article is amenable to home or factory usage , or for distribution for retail and industrial applications .
it thus will be seen that there is provided a spring type embroidery hoop or knitting ring which achieves the various objects of the invention , and which is well adapted to meet the conditions of practical use .
as various possible embodiment might be made of the above invention , and as various changes might be made in the embodiments above set forth , it is to be understood that all matter herein described or shown in the accompanying drawings is to be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense .
