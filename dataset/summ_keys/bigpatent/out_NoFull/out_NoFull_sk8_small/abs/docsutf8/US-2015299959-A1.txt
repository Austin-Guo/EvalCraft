this definition includes bacterial cellulose or nanocellulose spun with either traditional spinning techniques or with electrostatic spinning .
also microfibrillated cellulose as defined more in detail below is included in this definition .
it is a material typically made from wood cellulose fibers , both from hardwood or softwood fibers .
it can also be made from microbial sources , agricultural fibers such as wheat straw pulp , bamboo or other non wood fiber sources .
in microfibrillated cellulose the individual microfibrils have been partly or totally detached from each other .
fibers that has been fibrillated and which have microfibrils on the surface and microfibrils that are separated and located in a water phase of a slurry are included in the definition mfc .
almost all pcc is made by direct carbonation of hydrated lime , known as the milk of lime process .
the pcc may then be used in paper industry as a filler or pigmentation agent or coating agent .
