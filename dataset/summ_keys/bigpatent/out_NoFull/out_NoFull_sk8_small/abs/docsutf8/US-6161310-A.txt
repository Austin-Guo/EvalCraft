preferably , the outlet portion is a collar fixedly mounted to the exit end of the body 12 .
the ends of the outlet portion 14 and inlet portion 16 preferably have a crimped peripheral edge to physically reduce their outer diameters and permit easy insertion of the outlet portion 14 into the exhaust duct and the inlet portion 16 into the dryer vent exhaust .
it is within the scope of the invention for the inlet and outlet to be received over the dryer exhaust vent and exhaust duct , respectively .
in such instance , the inlet fits over the dryer exhaust vent and the outlet is received within the exhaust duct to reduce any edges against which lint in the airflow can be trapped .
it is also within the scope of the invention for the outlet portion to be rotatably mounted and the inlet portion can be fixedly mounted .
the rectangular portion provides a reduced depth for a given cross sectional area as compared to prior art circular cross sections .
the transition portion changes the cross sectional shape from rectangular to circular , permitting the outlet 14 to be connected to a standard circular exhaust duct .
the front 20 and rear 22 will be described in greater detail in the context of their manufacture and assembly .
