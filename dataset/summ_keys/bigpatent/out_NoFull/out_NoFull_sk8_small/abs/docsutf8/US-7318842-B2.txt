for instance , the polyether compound ( a ) may be synthesized by the successive addition of an alkylene oxide having 2 to 4 carbon atoms to the monovalent to tetravalent hydroxy compound having a hydrocarbon group , which corresponds to t in formula 1 .
when the alkylene oxides are used in admixture , they may be added to the hydroxy compound in random addition , block addition , and blockrandom addition forms .
for instance , use may be made of a process wherein an alkyl halide reacts with a metal complex salt of the polyether compound ( a ) .
for instance , use may be made of a process wherein an acyl halide reacts with a metal complex salt of the polyether compound ( a ) .
for instance , use may be made of processes wherein an alkyl halide reacts with a metal complex salt of the polyether compound ( a ) and an acyl halide reacts with the resulting reaction product .
such organic dicarboxylic acids and ester forming derivaties thereof , when used for polycondensation , may be used alone or in combination of two or more .
the polyolefin wax used as the functional agent , for instance , includes oxidized polyethylene wax and copolymers of Î± olefin and unsaturated fatty acids .
in the agent for treating biodegradable synthetic yarns according to the present invention , one or two or more compounds selected from such polyether compounds , polyether polyester compounds and polyolefin waxes as explained above is or are used as the functional agent or agents .
