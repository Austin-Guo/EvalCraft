next , one embodiment of the interlabial product of the present invention shall be described referring to figures ; however the present invention is not limited to this .
fig1 a is a perspective figure showing the interlabial product according to this embodiment , and fig1 b is a cross sectional view of fig1 a along the line x x inside in the interlabial product according to this embodiment .
note that though the interlabial product 1 in this embodiment is plane , it is not especially limited in the present invention provided that the shape can be maintained by placing it between labia , such as the rectangular type , bottle gourd type , droplet type , etc .
a surface side sheet 2 according to the present invention comprises the hydrophilic fiber composed of filament that is one single fiber and the fibril fiber provided with a lot of branch hairs branching from the surface of the fiber , as shown in fig3 a .
at least a part of these branch hairs forms a bridge structure for mutually bridging between the filament and the neighboring fibril fiber , and the fibers are mutually connected .
moreover , the surface side sheet 2 is produced by intertwining these blended fiber laminated bodies by the high pressure water flow before drying , and by adjusting the density to 0 .
the fiber used for this surface side sheet 2 is the one to be biodegraded to gases such as carbon dioxide or methane , water , and biomasses according to the process of nature , in the presence of bacteria including the ray fungi and other microbes , and under the anaerobic or aerobic condition .
in addition , those free from elution material , or , free from chemical stimulation , even if elution material eludes , in the wet state under wearing is preferable , in consideration of the chemical stimulation to the wearer .
