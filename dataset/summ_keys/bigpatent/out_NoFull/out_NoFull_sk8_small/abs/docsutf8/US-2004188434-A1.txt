the present invention relates to a basket to perform machine dyeing of articles that are normally dyed in cabinets with drawers of another type and that require more burdensome processes in terms of time .
currently , the process to dye articles takes place essentially using two types of equipment depending on the characteristics of the untreated article and the characteristics desired for the finished product .
the dyeing process comprises a first phase to wet the articles being treated with water , a second phase for the actual dyeing , during which the articles are immersed in a dye bath , a third centrifugation phase to aid removal of the excess dye liquor and a drying phase .
generally , said dyeing process takes place utilizing large baskets inside which the articles to be dyed are amassed and subsequently subjected to all the phases related to the dyeing process inside baskets .
in particular , microfiber articles can not be treated in normal baskets as this could cause problems of uneven dye diffusion due to a distribution of the material inside the basket that prevents the dye liquor from reaching the entire content and during circulation of the dye bath this uneven distribution can be worsened by the articles amassing only in some areas of the basket causing folds to form and consequent problems of rope marks .
articles to be dyed that can not be amassed inside traditional dyeing baskets are placed in cabinets provided with drawers , inside which these articles are positioned to guarantee correct and even wetting by the dye liquor in the case of microfiber articles and maintaining of the fold in the case of pre pressed articles .
in fact , the articles are placed inside said cabinets to be subjected to the first wetting phase and to the second actual dyeing phase .
after these phases the articles must be transferred manually by an operator from the cabinet with drawers to a specific basket suitable to hold them to be subjected to the centrifugation phase and eliminate excess dye from the fibers .
