having reference now to the drawings , and with particular reference to fig1 there is shown a typical hospital laundry area in which there is a laundry receiving or soiled laundry room 10 and a clean laundry room 11 , the two rooms being separated by a wall 12 .
in accordance with the invention , a wall adapter generally indicated at 14 is built into the separating wall 12 so that a tilt type washer extractor machine having a single access door can be utilized , such a machine being generally indicated at 15 .
the washer extractor machine shown in the drawings is a commercially available machine and is not per se a part of the present invention .
the cylinder can be pivoted or tilted by hydraulic cylinders , one of which is shown at 20 in fig4 between three basic positions .
as best shown in fig4 and 6 , the adapter 14 is open on its front side and the adapter is incorporated in the separating wall 12 so that this side faces or opens into the clean room 11 .
as indicated in fig1 and 4 6 , the front edges of the adapter side and top walls are connected to the separating wall 12 , the connection being such that a sealed joint is obtained between the wall 12 and adapter .
the flange 34 is dimensioned so that it registers with the channel 31 whereby the outer edge of the flange is pressed into sealing engagement with the resilient gasket material 32 , fig4 and 7 , when the machine is in its forwardly tilted unloading position .
in operation , the washer extractor machine is initially in its rearwardly tilted loading position as shown in fig5 and in phantom lines in fig4 .
