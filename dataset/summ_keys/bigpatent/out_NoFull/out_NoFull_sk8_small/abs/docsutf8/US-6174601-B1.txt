the resulting fiber was tested and examined and was found to exhibit undesirable characteristics as listed and as explained above .
lower crystallinity at the present time is attributed to be a factor in the desired results obtained .
the ctfe rich e ctfe has less volume crystallinity , a lower melting point allowing for faster quenching and greater undrawn elongation than the bicomponent fiber utilizing standard e ctfe as the sheath component .
another method to lower crystallinity is the inclusion of an additional monomer in e ctfe .
the additional monomer is selected from those copolymerizable olefinic fluorinated and non fluorinated monomers which when incorporated into e ctfe will reduce the crystallinity .
the lower volume crystallinity sheath core fiber e ctfe can be drawn more than such sheath core fiber utilizing standard e ctfe without the sheath cracking .
while the modified e ctfe with 55 : 45 molar ratio was successful , it is anticipated that other similar ratios in the vicinity of that ratio also may be expected to exhibit similar desirable and advantageous characteristics in such applications .
e ctfe with such desired and advantageous characteristics can also be obtained by incorporation of appropriate modifying monomer during polymerization .
