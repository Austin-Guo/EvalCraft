inside the casing 1 there is a drum 8 for operating as a filter surface leaving an annular space 9 for the filtrate therebetween .
by arranging the form of the rotor 10 such that it accelerates the pulp to a sufficient circumferential speed , it is possible to carry out a sufficiently efficient mixing of pulp with this arrangement .
an alternative is to arrange the thickening drum as a rotor , whereby the purpose of the counter part , the stator , is to act to keep the pulp stationary or let it flow axially downwards between the rotating drum and the stator .
it is also possible to attach equipment to the apparatus for discharging light impurities , such as plastics or like .
due to the rotation of the rotor , the pulp being thickened is continuously being mixed so that the consistency is increased uniformly throughout the pulp layer in said filtering chamber .
the liquid being filtered through the openings of the filtering surface is discharged via outlet connection 4 from the filtrate chamber 9 and the thickened pulp via outlet connection 3 from the lower part of the apparatus .
another embodiment is illustrated in fig2 and includes a thickening apparatus , which is mainly composed of the same components as the apparatus in accordance with fig1 .
a bulge member 21 is illustrated with the upstream edge thereof being steep and the downstream edge inclined a member 22 is a variation of member 21 and is a rib which extends close to the surface of filter plate , the upstream edge of which is steep and the downstream edge inclined throughout the rib .
