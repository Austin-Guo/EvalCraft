a cylindrical protective sheath unit 3 of a predetermined length is fitted on the circumference of a lower end portion of the cable 2 immediately above the beam 11 .
after fitting the split segments 30 on the cable 2 , they are secured to each other by bolts , rivets , press in fit or welding in such a manner as to hold the cable 2 from opposite sides .
the sheath unit 3 thus fitted on the cable 2 is shifted upward along the cable by a distance corresponding to its length by pulling a rope which is passed around a pulley 12 at the upper end of the tower 10 , and then a fresh protective sheath unit 3 is fitted on the cable 2 in the same manner .
the upper end of the lower or succeeding sheath unit 3 is fitted into the lower end of the preceding sheath unit 3 , and the overlapped end portions of the two sheath units 3 are fastened to each other by bolts or other suitable means .
if desired , the connecting end portions of the preceding and succeeding sheath units may be secured to each other by butt welding .
the two connected sheath units 3 are lifted upward by pulling the rope 13 again , and another fresh protective sheath unit 3 is fitted on the cable 2 and connected to the lower end of the second unit 3 .
in this manner , fresh protective and / or aesthetic sheath units are connected one after another until the cable 2 is covered with the sheath 3 over the entire length thereof .
in this instance , instead of being lifted by the rope 13 , the connected sheath units 3 may be pushed up each time by a distance corresponding to their unit length , or alternatively the first sheath unit 3 may be fitted on the upper end of the cable 2 which is accessible from the top end portion of the tower 10 , successively lowering the sheath units 3 along the cable 2 after fitting and connecting fresh sheath units 3 to the upper end of the preceding units 3 .
