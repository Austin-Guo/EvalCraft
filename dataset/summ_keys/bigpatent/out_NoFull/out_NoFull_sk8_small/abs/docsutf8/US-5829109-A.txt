the preferred embodiments of the stocker for wire healds according to the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the drawings .
fig1 is a perspective view to show a horizontal placement type stocker for wire healds according to the present embodiment .
the wire heald stocker 10 shown in the same figure has a housing 11 for keeping the wire healds b horizontal and layered in a vertical stack .
this housing 11 is formed to be so slender as to match with the slender shape of wire healds b and comprises a flat base 12 , a frame body 13 fixed as standing on this base 12 , and a heald drawing opening 9 cut at the lower front end so as to be horizontally slender .
this frame body 13 has ring receiving portions 14 located at the both ends thereof for receiving the ring portions 7 of wire healds b .
a bar shaped floating rod 16 extending vertically is inserted in each ring receiving portion 14 .
the outer peripheral shape of each floating rod 16 is nearly identical to the inner peripheral shape of ring portion 7 , thereby enabling stable stacking of wire Ëœ healds b .
further , the floating rod 16 is light in weight , and the surface thereof is mirror finished to facilitate sliding of wire healds b and is processed by an anti abrasion surface treatment to be resistant to scratches by the wire heald b .
