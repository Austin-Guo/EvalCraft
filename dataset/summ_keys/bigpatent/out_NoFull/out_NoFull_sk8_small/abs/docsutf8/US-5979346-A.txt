the thrust of the present invention is to provide a method for modifying an existing , commercially available baseline motor driven sewing machine to produce a modified motor driven machine which will automatically form stitches along the periphery of work pieces of widely varying shapes and thicknesses with minimum operator involvement .
a readily commercially available motor driven sewing machine was first selected for modification in accordance with one form of the method of the invention .
this machine which is manufactured by the juki company of japan and sold under the model designation m0 2504 series , comprises a one needle , three thread overlock machine of relatively standard construction .
in addition to the reciprocating needle , the means for moving the needle through a sewing point located on a work surface , and the means for feeding thread to the needle , the baseline machine includes a throat plate the character shown in fig1 .
the throat plate is connected to the work surface and is provided with first and second spaced apart feed dog receiving slots for receiving portions of the feed dogs of the invention , the character of which is shown in fig2 .
a presser foot subassembly is disposed above the work surface and a biasing spring acts upon the assembly for continuously urging the presser foot in a direction toward the work surface .
the feed dogs of the juki apparatus which include a main feed dog , an auxiliary feed dog and a differential feed dog function to advance the work piece relative to the needle .
as shown in fig1 the differential feed dog which is identified by the numeral 20 , has first and second spaced apart rows of work piece engaging teeth receivable respectively in the first and second feed dog receiving slots formed in the throat plate .
