the figures show a trough mangle for commercial laundries .
the trough mangle has a cylindrical mangle roll 10 , which can be driven so as to rotate about a longitudinal mid axis 11 .
the mangle trough 12 surrounds approximately the lower half of the mangle roll 10 , so that the mangle trough 12 is approximately semicircular in cross section .
the right hand longitudinal edge 13 of the mangle trough 12 in fig1 is associated with an inlet side 16 of the trough mangle and is firmly connected to the frame 15 .
the opposite longitudinal edge 14 on an outlet side 17 is mounted on the frame 15 such that it can move on the frame 15 , via a slightly skewed swinging support 18 which is preferably continuous in the longitudinal direction of the mangle trough 12 .
such a gap primarily makes it easier to insert the pieces of laundry to be mangled between the mangle roll 10 and the mangle trough 12 .
the gap shown in fig1 between the mangle trough 12 and the mangle roll 10 merely serves for illustrative purposes and explanatory purposes ; in actual fact , it is not present during operation of the trough mangle .
the resilient mangle trough 12 is formed of two trough halves 21 and 22 in the trough mangle shown here .
