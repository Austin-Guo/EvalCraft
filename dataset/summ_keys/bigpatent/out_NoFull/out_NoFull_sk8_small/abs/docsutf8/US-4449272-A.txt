all of these may be generally conventional or well known , commercially available items of equipment .
the ideal spatial relationship of the card 16 to the chute feed 12 is the one which causes the output of the card to have minimized side to side variation , so that as divided and furnished to the coilers , should there be two as shown , the left side and right side products as are indistinguishable from one another as possible , and each is a consistent product .
however , the present inventor has found that an adjustment feature is needed in order to achieve the actual ideal spatial relationship , whether the effect of adjustment is to produce or to cause more or less variation from the co planarity just referred to .
in a preferred embodiment , the adjustment feature 20 is physically located so as to act between the chute feed 12 and whatever it is that the chute feed is supported upon in order to pivot , swivel , skew , turn or similarly to move the chute feed slightly in a generally angular sense about a generally vertical axis without causing any significant lateral translation of the chute feed , i .
such as would disturb connections of fiber feed ducting to the chute feed , or of drive connections extending between the chute feed and the card .
as illustrated in fig3 an exemplary way that this can be accomplished is to provide the adjustment feature 20 at one lateral end of the chute feed , which , upon adjustment moves that end of the chute feed towards and away from the card along an arc generally indicated by the double headed arrow 26 .
the axis of this arcuate movement in this instance may be located in the vicinity of the opposite lateral end of the chute feed , e .
however , if considered necessary or desirable a similar adjustment feature may be provided at 28 , so that when only the adjustment feature at 20 is adjusted , pivotal movement is about an axis at 28 , and when only the adjustment feature at 28 is adjusted , pivotal movement is about an axis at 20 , whereas if both are adjusted , e .
