for this reason , the aim of the invention is to provide a device having an ironing board and an iron that can easily be folded away against a wall , having the appearance of a mirror or a painting and also quickly unfolded so as to be capable of being functional immediately , without using rotating mechanical parts , reducing the useful surface for the ironing board .
the invention therefore relates to a foldaway device for ironing linens including a frame attached to the wall in which an ironing board is located surrounded by a mobile frame and having a rear portion having an ironing surface and a front portion integral with the rear portion constituting a decorative surface or a mirror .
the ironing board can adopt a first position in which the front portion is visible in the frame attached to the wall and the rear portion is folded away , and a second position in which the front portion is folded away and the rear portion is made visible in the frame attached to the wall .
the device has first pivoting means suitable for moving the ironing board from the first position to the second position , and vice versa , and second pivoting means for moving the ironing board in the second position from the vertical position to the horizontal position as a bracket so that a user can use the ironing surface .
in reference to fig1 , the ironing board has , in a first position , a front portion 10 that is a decorative surface such as a table or a mirror inside a frame 12 attached to the wall .
behind the front portion , a rear portion is formed by the ironing board and the steam iron associated with modern ironing devices such as a brush integrating a perforated tube enabling a steam jet to be sprayed on a linen placed on the board .
as described below , when the decorative surface or the mirror is visible , the rear portion is folded away in a cavity of the wall inside the frame 12 .
