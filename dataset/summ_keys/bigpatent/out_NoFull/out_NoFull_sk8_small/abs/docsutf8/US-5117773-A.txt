referring now more particularly to fig1 to 3 of the drawings which show our presently preferred mode of carrying out the invention with a hook shaft 1 shown in cross section positioned within a bushing 11 which is provided with lubrication inlet 2 and lubrication outlet 3 , spaced from each other .
hook shaft 1 is provided with a hollow interior and has a reduced area portion 4 positioned between hook shaft inlet 23 and hook shaft outlet 22 .
the other side of hook shaft 1 is provided with a closure wall and closure member 15 having an oil supply channel 6 .
the oil supply channel 6 has a longitudinal axis which is eccentric to or displaced from the axis of hook shaft 1 .
in this embodiment oil supply channel 6 is neither co axial with nor aligned with longitudinal axis 5 as will be explained subsequently during the explanation of the operation .
outer portion of hook shaft 1 is provided with a spiral undercut 12 which works in connection with bushing 11 as a pump .
insert part 208 can be made from metal , plastic or any other type of solid material .
the purpose of insert part 208 is to prevent the porous material 207 from soaking up oil which collects in the bottom of the hollow hook shaft , if the machine is stopped in the position shown in fig3 .
