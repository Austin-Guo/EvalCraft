the drum in accordance with the invention for drying paper pulp or the like shown in fig1 comprises a rotating outer drum cylinder 1 the periphery of which constitutes the & # 34 ; table & # 34 ; of the drum which supports the paper pulp or other product to be dried ; this tubular drum cylinder is cylindrical in shape ; its opposite ends are closed by flanges 2 adapted to compensate for expansion of the drum cylinder and incorporating hubs 21 of which one incorporates a toothed wheel 22 through which the drum cylinder is rotated by motor drive means ; the hubs 21 are therefore mounted to rotate on a fixed tubular shaft 3 , about opposite ends 31 of the shaft 3 which serves as a supporting framework for heating elements , as will be described later ; the hubs 21 are mounted to rotate on the ends 31 of the hollow shaft 3 by means of respective ball bearings 5 at the driving end and the transmission end of the drum ; the central part of the shaft 3 and its ends 31 are made as three separate parts attached together by hot sleeving or by welding ; the ends 31 of the shaft 3 which carry the hubs 21 of the flanges 2 are of smaller diameter than its central part and in contact with the latter through a centering member inserted into the central part and a supporting base having an outside diameter substantially equal to that of this central part .
a bush 4 is housed inside each end 31 ; the bush 4 is mounted in the end 31 in such a way as to be fastened to it when the drum is operating but so that the end 31 and all of the shaft 3 can be rotated independently of the bush 4 during any necessary maintenance operations , for example to bring a defective element opposite an access formed in the corresponding flange , in order to withdraw it from the drum .
the free ends of the bushes 4 are housed in casings 6 for fixing the drum as a whole to longitudinal drum support members 7 carried by a supporting framework ( not shown ) .
the central part of the shaft 3 carries a hollow heating body 9 comprising a tubular inside jacket 91 and a tubular outside jacket 92 in a thermally and electrically insulative material , attached by demountable fixing devices 93 ; the outside jacket is made up of heating elements in the form of panels serving as supports for elongate electrical heating elements , to be more precise main heating elements 10a and profile control heating elements lob ; the demountable fixing devices 93 enable the separation and extraction of the heating panels of which there are , for example , eight in circumferential sequence to constitute the outside jacket , which corresponds to an angle of 45 degrees subtended at the center by each panel ; the extraction of the heating panels can be facilitated by the fact that the flanges 2 are themselves in a number of parts , preferably in as many juxtaposed parts as the outside jacket , for example eight parts arranged as circular sectors each having an angle at the center of 45 degrees ; another possibility is for the flanges 2 to incorporate openings of sufficiently large size to enable the heating elements to pass through ; the elements 10a , lob extend longitudinally relative to the heating body , along generatrices of an imaginary cylinder , possibly with more than one element disposed on the same generatrix ; the end parts of each element are bent at 90 Â° to pass through the thickness of the outside jacket 92 , and their ends proper terminate between the two jackets 91 , 92 and are each provided with an electrical connection lug 101 for supplying them with electrical power .
the insulative outside jacket 92 , and in particular each heating panel , has a u shape profile in longitudinal cross section and its horizontal part forms a sleeve around the inside jacket ; it is this sleeve which carries the elements 10a , 10b ; applied to the outside surface of this jacket is a heat reflector 94 , the role of which is to reflect towards the drum cylinder the heat emitted into the heating chamber 100 defined between the reflector 94 and the inside surface of the drum cylinder 1 by the electrical heating elements 10a , 10b carried by the sleeve .
the inside surface of the drum cylinder 1 ( fig2 ) is subdivided internally , for example by means of attached ribs or bars 11 so that , the elements being fixed like the jackets and all the central part of the drum , when the drum turns there is created a sort of turbine provoking circulation of air around the electrical heating elements , enabling the radiation from each element to reach the inside wall of the drum cylinder 1 and the reflector 94 preferably in line with the active heating surface of the elements 10a , 10b , so that the drum cylinder is heated annularly .
the turbine significantly increases both efficiency and reliability , which is of particular benefit in the case of large scale applications .
the distribution of the elements in the axial and circumferential directions enables uniform or variable heating of all the surface of the drum cylinder , the number , size , circumferential pitch and distribution of the elements being computed according to the required evaporation capacity and the size of the transverse sections heating of which is to be controlled .
