this invention pertains to pigment micro agglomerate coloring systems for coloring synthetic fibers and textile materials , either permanently or temporarily .
in the invention certain starch and cellulosic derivatives are softened with poly hydric alcohols to form glycolate modified derivatives ( gmd ) .
the pigment gmd agglomerate may be colloidally combined with a latex binder to form a complex pigment gmd binder agglomerate .
the ability to make these soft , thickener type derivatives is crucial to this invention .
the starch or cellulosic derivatives are reacted under acid conditions with the glycols .
as the reaction proceeds , a definite change can be noted .
the kinds of products that can be made are numerous , by varying the reaction conditions and the reactants .
the viscosity of the solution will adjust at this point , becoming lower .
