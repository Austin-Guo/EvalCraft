the present invention is utilized in a tufting machine of the type generally including a needle bar carrying one or more rows of longitudinally spaced needles and which is supported and reciprocally driven by a plurality of push rods .
in the tufting zone , the needles carry yarns which are driven through a backing fabric by the reciprocation of the needles .
while penetrating the backing fabric , a plurality of longitudinally spaced hooks cooperate with the needles to seize loops of yarns and thereby form the face of a resulting fabric .
in some cases the hooks will cooperate with knives to cut the loops of yarn seized on the hooks and thereby form a cut pile face for the fabric .
the present invention is directed to modular units for holding loopers or hooks and for holding needles to facilitate their cooperation during the tufting process .
the gauge bar 25 and guide bar 30 are used in concert to position the individual modular blocks 15 relative to one another .
one modular block 15 in fig2 is disassembled and removed from the gauge bar 25 to reveal the spaced parallel slots 50 divided by vertical walls 51 located on the front surface 55 of the block for receiving the proximal ends 75 of the gauge element 10 .
when the gauge elements 10 are positioned in the modular block 15 , the pinholes 70 align with apertures formed in side surfaces of the block such as pin opening 85 .
