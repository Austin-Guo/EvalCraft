the suspension underwent agitation for one hour before the filtrate was removed .
the pulp was then subjected to washing in four stages .
each washing stage lasted for one hour under agitation .
all filtrates were kept for analysis .
the amount of sodium in the washing water was determined using atom absorption and cod according to the dr .
the carbon dioxide flow was constant and uniform in all experiments .
the effect becomes manifest already in the stage where the carbon dioxide addition took place , i .
total amount of washed out cod will be higher in an addition of co 2 in the 2nd washing stage .
