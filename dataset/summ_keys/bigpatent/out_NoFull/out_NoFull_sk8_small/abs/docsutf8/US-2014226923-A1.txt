prior to turning to the bulk bag of the present invention , reference is made to fig1 a through 4c to discuss the prior state of the art in bulk bags in general .
this example illustrates the shape of the bag before it is filled with product .
however , as illustrated in fig1 b , the bulk bag 10 is filled with product , the bulk material naturally piles up inside the bag in a conical shape with equal forces in all directions .
this equal force reshapes the bag side walls 12 above the square bottom 16 into a cylindrical shaped bag 18 .
this causes a transitional area 17 that starts from the bottom 16 and ends when the bag has reached full cylindrical shape 18 .
the results that occur because of this difference is illustrated in fig2 a and 2b .
these three figures together illustrate the issue that unsupported columns of product create .
it depicts the initial height 63 of a recently filled bulk bag .
