it is thus an object of the invention to provide a washability enhancing compound of low molecular weight and low viscosity which is compatible with inks , colorants , dyes , and the like .
it is another object of this invention to provide a washability enhancing compound which can be added in very high proportions to a marker composition without increasing the viscosity a deleteriously high amount for standard marker performance .
a further object of the invention is to provide a washable marker comprising a marker composition which is easily removed from surfaces such as skin and clothing but exhibits a high affinity for standard writing surfaces , such as paper .
yet another object of this invention is to provide a relatively inexpensive and yet highly effective stain blocker compound for use within washable marker compositions .
such a specific copolymer thus must also possess an intrinsic viscosity of from about 1 .
0 centipoise , are generally present with a certain solids content prior to introduction within the target compositions .
upon mixing , the solids are dissolved and the overall viscosity of the resultant composition should be at most about 7 .
0 ( if a marker composition is desired ) , although the final viscosity may be much higher if other types of washable coloring compositions are desired .
