the low capacity smoothing iron comprises a housing 1 , which is closed by a soleplate 2 at the bottom .
the soleplate has a low heat capacity and is of very thin cross section , which has become possible by the use of reinforcement ribs 3 .
above the reinforcement ribs 3 the soleplate 2 is covered by a partition 3a of a glass ceramic or borosilicate , so that a cavity 3b is formed which serves as steam or evaporation chamber , particularly if the water is evaporated in the iron itself .
the steam ports may also be situated in the soleplate in the direct radiation field of the lamps and reflector .
the present embodiment has a steam pipe 8 leading to the steam compartment 5 and to a steam nozzle 9 .
in the present embodiment the steam is supplied to the iron from a separate steam generator via a duct 11 .
two halogen lamps 6 extend parallel to the plane of the soleplate 2 and reflectors 7 arranged above them serve to project all the light emitted by the halogen lamps onto the soleplate 2 .
on the soleplate , which is absorbent at its inner side , a temperature sensor 12 is arranged to detect the temperature of the soleplate .
