the alcohols useful in the practice of this invention are commonly called fatty alcohols .
however , saturated alcohols are preferred since unsaturated alcohols will result in quaternized products having a tendency to cause yellowing or discoloration of the treated fabric .
for economic reasons , the commercially available synthetically derived straight chain primary alcohols are preferred .
the latter alcohols are obtained by polymerizing ethylene in accordance with ziegler chemistry .
the branched primary alcohols useful herein likewise are commercially available as mixtures with the straight chain isomers .
, predominately single methyl branching , are readily obtained in the production of long chain alcohols by the oxo process .
an applicable catalyst of this type is disclosed in u .
% based on the weight of the charged alcohol mixture .
