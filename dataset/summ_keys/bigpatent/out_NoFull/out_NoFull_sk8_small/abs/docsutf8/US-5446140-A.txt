the present invention relates to a blend of cellulose acetate and starch acetate and other inventions derived from the novel blend , as well as , a process to prepare this blend .
the present invention also provides a process for making spun yarn from said blend comprising the steps of preparing a mixture of cellulose acetate and starch acetate , solutioning the mixture in a suitable solvent , mixing , filtering , and then spinning the resultant blend in a spinning cabinet .
any type of spinning which is routinely used in the preparation of cellulose acetate is contemplated .
these include dry spinning , wet spinning and melt spinning .
an alternate method to prepare the blend is to co precipitate a cellulose acetate and starch acetate reaction mixture in water in the proper ratio already in acetate manufacturing and then to follow routine cellulose acetate preparation steps including spinning .
to remove the solvent from the spun yarn by evaporation .
the preferred solvent in the process of the present invention is acetone .
solvents suitable for the process of this invention are any nonaqueous solvents capable of creating an extrudable dope .
