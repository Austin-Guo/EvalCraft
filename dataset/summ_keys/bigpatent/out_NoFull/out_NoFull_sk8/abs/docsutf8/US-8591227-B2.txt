during a teeth whitening treatment in a dental office , a whitening gel is applied to the teeth and a protective barrier is placed on the gums , the mucosa and lips to prevent burning of the tissues by the high concentration of hydrogen peroxide in the whitening gel .
a leading edge of the whitening gel is placed on a tooth surface .
an led based white light is placed a few inches from a tooth surface to help activate free radical oxygen , most of which becomes lost into the air .
in this invention , the mouthpiece seals or encloses a photosensitive agent , such as carbamide or hydrogen peroxide gel , to prevent the loss of the active electrons of the photosensitive agent ( carbamide or hydrogen peroxide ) into the air .
the mouthpiece holds led based white light sources and alternating heat resistors .
a power source , which may be remote from the mouthpiece , is in electrical connection with the led based white light sources and heat resistors via a wire .
the power source energizes the led based white light sources and heat resistors which generate light rays and a warming heat .
the light rays strike the tooth surface on the front and the edge and the back of the edge , i .
