in the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments , reference is made to the accompanying drawings , which form a part thereof , and within which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments by which the invention may be practiced .
it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the invention .
certain embodiments of the current invention can be used in lieu of hip hemiarthroplasty and / or hip pinning in a sedentary or household ambulating patient who has a hip fracture .
the advantages of the device are immediate fixation of the fracture , immediate weight bearing after surgery , and reduced invasiveness compared to a hip hemiarthroplasty .
hip hemiarthroplasty is performed more commonly for hip fractures than hip pinning because pinning requires a stable fracture pattern .
a patient is positioned supine on an operating table .
the operative leg can be internally rotated by about 15 Â° to compensate for normal hip anteversion , such that the surgeon can orient instruments parallel to the operating room floor , ceiling , operating table , or other landmark to achieve correct orientation to the femoral neck .
additional portals may be required to effectively immobilize femoral head 4 so that the burr may be used effectively .
