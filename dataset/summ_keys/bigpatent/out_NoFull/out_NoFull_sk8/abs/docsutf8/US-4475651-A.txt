film feed assembly 22 maintains a taut curtain 23 of thermoplastic film extending across the work zone upstream of the sealing jaws .
label transfer assembly 26 transfers labels from feeder 24 to the work zone immediately upstream of the film curtain maintained by assembly 22 .
an electrostatic charging assembly 30 includes a grounding bar 32 extending across the width of the film curtain on the downstream side of the curtain and an applicator bar 34 extending across the width of the upstream side of the curtain across from the grounding bar .
conventional electrostatic generators ( not illustrated ) energize bars 32 and 34 so that opposite polarity electrostatic charges are generated by the bars and flowed toward the adjacent plastic film .
the bars and generators may be like those shown in u .
a roll support platform 54 extends along the upper runs of belts 42 a distance beyond the downstream ends of the belts to support rolls as they are moved toward the work zone 20 .
suitable drive means ( not illustrated ) lower and raise sealing jaws 16 and 18 to seal a loose envelope of film around a roll and re establish the film curtain extending across the work zone 20 .
label feeder 24 automatically feeds individual labels 61 to a pickup position located above and slightly upstream of the work zone .
