referring now to the drawings and particularly to fig1 3 , there is shown a doll construction including a lower torso member generally designated 12 and an upper torso member generally designated 14 , the upper torso member 14 being pivotally secured to the lower torso member 12 .
the upper torso member 14 is likewise generally hollow and formed from two halves or shells including a rear half 28 and a front half 30 suitably joined and configured to form the chest and back surfaces of the doll .
the upper portion of the upper torso terminates in a neck projection 32 to which is suitably secured a head ( not shown ) .
the upper surface of the lower torso member 12 terminates in a ball surface 38 at the midriff or waist portion of the lower torso member 12 where the two torso member portions are interconnected .
the upper torso member 14 , as will hereinafter be described , terminates in a skirt portion 40 , which defines the waist or midriff portion thereof , the skirt portion 40 having an arcuately figure peripheral edge forming socket means to matingly coact and slide with respect to the ball surface 38 .
as shown in dotted lines in fig2 a connecting member 42 has a washer like end 44 and an enlarged head end 46 with an interconnecting shaft or shank portion 48 .
a bushing aperture 50 is formed in the ball surface 38 and angularly disposed at 30 Â° with respect to the longitudinal center line of the lower torso member 12 .
the enlarged washer portion 44 of the connector 42 is fixedly secured to a pin 51 within the lower torso member 18 with the shank 48 extending in close abutting relation through the bushing aperture 50 for suitably broadly supporting the mid portion of the shank 48 .
