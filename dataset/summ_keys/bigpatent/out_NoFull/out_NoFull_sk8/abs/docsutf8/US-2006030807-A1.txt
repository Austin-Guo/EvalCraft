the present invention is a tensioning device that is portable and capable of mounting or connecting to a common door frame or fixed structure that selectively applies lumbar traction to a patient .
the device of the present invention includes an anchoring section that can be used to secure the device to a door frame or the like , a tension producing section that includes a mechanical spring coupled to a ratchet mechanism for increasing the spring & # 39 ; s tension , and a belt or harness section that is worn by the user .
the belt or harness can be used in conjunction with a pad or mat that incorporates a frictional surface that resists sliding of the pad or mat on the supporting surface such as a carpet , grass , or floor .
the anchoring section of the lumbar device in a first embodiment is a non resilient nylon tether 15 or belt connected at a distal end 20 to a plastic pipe 25 as shown in fig1 and 2 .
as long as tension applied to the tether 15 at the proximal end 35 does not exceed the deformation limit of the nylon tether or the connection measures at the pipe 25 , the tether 15 will remain in tension .
alternatively , the anchoring mechanism can be an expandable bar ( not shown ) that fits across the door frame and expands therein ( typically using a threaded member ) so was to wedge into the door frame .
the expandable bar is collapsible only when deactivated by the user to prevent unexpected loss of tension that can injure a patient .
the tensioning section of the device comprises a coiled mechanical spring 40 coupled to the proximal end 35 of the nylon tether 15 .
