the invention is best shown in comparison to my prior u .
in side view in fig1 i show a dry lay up for manufacture of a fiber composite structure 1 , utilizing the inventive vacuum bag 4 .
the composite 1 is formed on a rigid mold 6 , for this illustrative purpose a flat smooth table surface forming a backing for the fiber composite article 1 .
the shape of the mold 6 determines the shape of the final structure 1 , and thus the mold 6 can be curved or of any desired shape , as will be illustrated below .
in the prior art , a peel sheet 3 would be placed over the fiber lay up 2 , and then a distribution layer laid on the peel sheet to enhance flow of resin to impregnate the lay up 2 .
a resin entrance chamber would be centrally placed on the lay up with a communicating resin distribution chamber to communicate resin flow to the distribution layer .
a vacuum bag or sheet would then be placed over the entire assembled lay up and distribution layers , and sealed around its perimeter to the mold .
the vacuum both draws the resin throughout the fiber lay up , and presses the resin impregnated lay up against the rigid mold to smoothly form the desired fiber reinforced shape .
