while the passenger side exterior rearview mirror assembly typically would not include the invention , it may if it were so designed .
the mirror case 22 defines a primary opening 24 that faces rearward with respect to the forward motion of the motor vehicle 16 .
it should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the exterior rearview mirror assembly 10 may include fewer or more features , depending on the design and package choices and those features do not add or detract from the inventive method .
in the preferred embodiment , there is no need for a second backing plate for the secondary reflector 32 .
fig2 and 3 show the plan view and the side view respectively of the design elements of the invention .
the secondary reflector 32 is highly convex and provides a greater field of view than the primary reflector 30 .
in particular , the line of sight 48 extends from eye point 42 to an inboard edge 56 of the primary reflector 30 and that line of sight 48 is reflected rearward and represented by line of sight 58 , which is also referred to as the inboard boundary of the field of view for the primary reflector 30 .
the line of sight 50 extends from the eye point 44 to an outboard edge 60 of the primary reflector 30 and that line of sight is reflected rearward and represented by a line of sight 62 , which is referred to as the outboard boundary of the field of view for the primary reflector 30 .
