preferred embodiments of the present invention will hereinbelow be described with reference to the accompanying drawings .
reference numeral 8 designates a grinding barrel which is mounted on a grinding barrel mounting frame 11 after a 0finding material 9 and objects to be ground are enclosed therein .
reference numeral 13 designates a rotating shaft which projects toward the outside of the both sides of the grinding barrel fixing frame 11 .
the grinding barrel fixing frame 11 is rotated with the rotating shaft 13 at the center .
such changes in the position of the center o allow the grinding barrel to rotate in a complex manner which has never been seen as shown in fig8 .
further , when the grinding barrel 8 is mounted obliquely with respect to a central line l of the grinding barrel mounting frame 11 or the grinding barrel 8 , further complex rotations may be provided as shown in fig9 thereby producing a remarkable effect in a grazed finish and mirror polishing which require extremely fine grinding .
the grinding barrel 8 is provided with a balancing weight 17 for cancelling unbalance caused by the eccentric mounting of the grinding barrel 8 and the grinding material 9 and the objects 10 to be ground enclosed in the grinding barrel 8 .
fig1 illustrates a cross section of the grinding barrel 8 , where the center o is different from the center of the circulation of the grinding material 9 and the objects to be ground 10 in the barrel 8 , and the above mentioned complex movement is produced thereby .
