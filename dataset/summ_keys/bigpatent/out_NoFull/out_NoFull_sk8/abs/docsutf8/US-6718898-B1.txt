the assemblies 4 , 6 and 8 are generally similar in that each provides a controlled , resilient resistance to reciprocating movement of a piston that responds to forces in excess of a threshold force and over a flexion range of a contained resilient member and / or material .
the assembly 4 includes a spring that biases movement of the piston and is shown in greater detail in the exploded assembly drawing of fig2 .
either of the assemblies 4 or 6 may also be constructed with a closed hydraulic or pneumatic chamber that provides a resilient reciprocating motion to a contained piston .
the main sail lines 10 are anchored to the aft end of the sailboat 2 .
depending upon the size of the main sail 13 , the lines 10 can be controlled with one or more pulleys 24 in a block and tackle arrangement to obtain a desired mechanical advantage .
the length of the lines 10 are varied to control the orientation of the main boom 18 and main sail 13 relative to the main mast 26 .
the two mountings are shown in fig1 with respect to the different mounting positions of the assemblies 6 , it being appreciated that either of these mounting positions can be replicated on the other side of the sail .
in the one instance , as shown with respect to the background assembly 6 , both assemblies 6 can be mounted in close association to the jib / genoa 14 with the trailing lines 12 being secured to the port and starboard gunwales in conventional fashion .
