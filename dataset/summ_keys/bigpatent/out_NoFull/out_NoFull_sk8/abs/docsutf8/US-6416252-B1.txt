as indicated above , the present invention provides an alternative to current contaminant sequestration or soil removal methods .
according to the invention , a truly in situ procedure utilizes , for example , the capillary action of the soil to disseminate and help mix injected water soluble reagents , which will react and chemically form the reactive barrier in the soil itself .
the solutions contain chemical reagents which react in the soil and cause precipitation of a specific mineral that is targeted to sequester radioactive materials and heavy metals .
depending on conditions , including the extent to which the reactants are diluted as well as the ph and temperature of the reactants and surrounding soil environment , various calcium phosphate precipitates can be formed rapidly or slowly .
for the reasons mentioned above , apatite is a desirable barrier material , and the present invention is especially well suited to the formation of apatite barriers .
other phosphate materials can also have benefit in the context of radionuclide and heavy metal decontamination and sequestration , and the inventive principles of injection and capillary or groundwater dissemination and mixing have application in the context of such other phosphate material , as well .
also , as noted , over time brushite and other calcium phosphates can spontaneously convert into apatite .
conditions of ph , temperature , and reactant dilution affect the rate of reaction and success with which apatite is formed .
