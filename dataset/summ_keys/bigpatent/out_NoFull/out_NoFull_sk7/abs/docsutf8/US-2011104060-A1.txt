the present invention will preferably utilize microfabricated catheters for intravascular injection .
a more complete description of the catheters and methods for their fabrication is provided in u .
the present invention describes methods and kits useful for the delivery of neuromodulating agents into the adventitia around renal arteries in order to reduce blood pressure in the treatment of hypertension .
in each kit , a delivery catheter may be combined with instructions for use and a therapeutically effective amount of a neuromodulating agent as defined above .
the actuator body more or less forms a u shaped or c shaped outline having an opening or slit 12 d extending substantially along its length .
the catheter tip end serves as a means of locating the actuator inside a body lumen by use of a radio opaque coatings or markers .
the retaining rings form a flexible but relatively non distensible substantially “ u ” shaped or “ c ” shaped structure at each end of the actuator .
