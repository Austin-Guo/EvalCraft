referring to the drawings , fig1 shows the dental tray of the present invention , generally indicated at 10 , to include two u shaped portions , a lower portion 12 for treating the lower dentition and an upper portion 14 for treating the upper dentition .
the two portions are connected adjacent their posterior ends by a bridging strap 16 which forms a hinge when the tray is in use .
as best shown in fig2 each tray portion consists of an outer shell or substrate 18 , preferably made in a single piece by vacuum forming from a soft polyethlene foam .
bonded to the interior of the shell is a soft hydrophilic foam lining 20 .
the bonding can be accomplished by an suitable means such as with a chemical bonding agent .
however , it is preferred that the hydrophilic foam layer 20 be heat bonded to substrate 18 so as to eliminate any harmful effects from migrating chemicals or leaching of bonding agents .
while the entire tray of the present invention is formed in one integral piece , the various components of each tray portion will be described herein as separate elements to simplify the description thereof .
