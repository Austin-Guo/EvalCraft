referring now to the drawings , wherein like reference numerals refer to like parts throughout , there is seen in fig1 a first embodiment of a brake cylinder maintaining valve 10 that integrates a quick service limiting valve and a bcm reference pressure charging check valve into a single unitary structure that cooperates to provide all of the relevant functions with more precise control that otherwise possible .
nozzle 14 extends along a longitudinal axis through a brake cylinder pressure chamber 20 in an upper portion of a bushing 22 and through a narrow passageway 24 that separates brake cylinder pressure chamber 20 from a quick service pressure chamber 26 defined in a lower portion of bushing 22 .
it should be recognized that the various chambers are in communication with the corresponding elements of a conventional braking system such that the pressure in a particular chamber reflects the pressure in the corresponding element of the braking system .
for example , brake cylinder pressure chamber 20 is in open communication with a brake cylinder ( not shown ) so that the pressure in chamber 20 reflects the pressure in the brake cylinder .
nozzle 14 extends through brake cylinder pressure chamber 20 and into quick service pressure chamber 26 to define a first seat a , which selectively controls communication between a bcm reference pressure chamber 28 positioned above qslv diaphragm 18 and brake cylinder pressure chamber 20 , as well as a second seat b , which selectively controls communication between quick service pressure chamber 26 and brake cylinder pressure chamber 20 .
seat a is formed between the end of nozzle 14 and a check 30 positioned in quick service pressure chamber 26 so that check 30 is in contact with the end of nozzle 14 , seat a will be closed to seal off channel 16 .
a second seat b is formed by a clearance gap 32 between the outer surface of nozzle 14 and the interior of passageway 24 .
