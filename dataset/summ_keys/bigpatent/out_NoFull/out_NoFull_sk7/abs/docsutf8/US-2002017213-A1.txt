the substrate 10 may be made of any suitable material such as metal , plastic , wood or the like .
the substrate 10 may be substantially planar as shown in fig1 or may be provided with any desired contour .
in accordance with the present invention , the membrane is impregnated with an ink comprising a thermal transfer dye , a thermal transfer pigment and alternatively a protective polymer , as more fully described below .
as used herein , the term “ impregnated ” means that the ink is deposited on the surface of the membrane and / or within the membrane .
the platens 22 and 24 apply heat and pressure in order to cause thermal transfer of at least a portion of the thermal transfer dye , thermal transfer pigment and protective polymer from the membrane 14 to the surface layer 12 .
for medium and high energy dyes , the temperature being a function of the amount of pressure and time and the micronization of ingredients in the inks .
the thermal transfer dye component of the ink may comprise azo , amino , anthraquinone or other disperse dyes .
