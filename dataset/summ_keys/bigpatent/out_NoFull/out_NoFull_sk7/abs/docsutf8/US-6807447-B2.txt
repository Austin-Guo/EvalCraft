referring now to the drawings in detail wherein like reference numerals have been used throughout the various figures to designate like elements , there is shown in fig1 a catheter constructed in accordance with the principles of the present invention and designated generally as 10 .
as should be readily apparent to those skilled in the art , only the working portion of the catheter 10 is shown in the drawings .
carried on the working portion of the flexible member 12 of the catheter 10 are first , second , and third spaced apart electrode arrays , the details of which will be described hereinafter .
electrical wires ( not shown ) from the electrode arrays pass through the interior of the flexible member 12 to a manifold secured to the remote end of the flexible member 12 for connecting the catheter 10 to appropriate electronic equipment .
located adjacent the proximal end 14 is the first electrode array .
the array includes approximately ten electrodes 18 a 18 j where each electrode has an approximate length of five millimeters and each electrode is spaced approximately five millimeters away from each adjacent electrode .
a steering arrangement known in the art may be associated with the catheter 10 in order to direct the placement of the electrode arrays .
