in the present context , the phrase “ medical prosthetic device and implant ” includes within its scope any device intended to be implanted into the body of a vertebrate animal , in particular a mammal such as a human .
a non limiting list of main groups of and species biomolecules that are contemplated as being suitable for incorporation into a metal hydride layer ( in a stable and / or physiologically reversible manner ) in accordance with the invention is given below .
cell attachment factors are biomolecules that mediate attachment and spreading of cells onto biological surfaces or other cells and tissues .
this group of molecules typically contains molecules participating in cell matrix and cell cell interaction during vertebrate development , neogenesis , regeneration and repair .
this class of proteins typically contains any dissolved or aggregated protein which normally is present whole blood .
enzymes are any protein or peptide that have a specific catalytic effect on one ore more biological substrates which can be virtually anything from simple sugars to complex macromolecules like dna .
enzymes are potentially useful for triggering biological responses in the tissue by degradation of matrix molecules , or they could be used to activate or release other bioactive compounds in the implant coating .
