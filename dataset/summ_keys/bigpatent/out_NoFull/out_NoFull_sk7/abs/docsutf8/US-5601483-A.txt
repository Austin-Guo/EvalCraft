in fig1 an exemplary embodiment of the invention is labeled in its entirety with the number 10 .
one end of the hollow spindle 24 projects outward from the gear drive housing 12 and is configured as a counterflange 26 with which is associated an external clamping flange 28 to clamp a tool 29 located between them , which in the example shown is a grinding disk .
a quick clamping device which has a tension spindle 36 , coaxial with the hollow spindle 24 , that is joined integrally to the clamping flange 28 is provided in order to allow manual clamping and unclamping of the tool 29 .
the tension spindle 36 can be displaced in the axial direction by means of a displacement unit via a clamping lever 74 that can pivot about an axis 80 .
the pusher element 42 has internal threads 35 into which the tension spindle 36 can be threaded with external threads 33 provided at its upper end .
arranged between the intermediate flange 32 and the outer clamping flange 28 is a spring washer 37 that is depicted in the right half of the tension spindle 36 , compressed between the intermediate flange 32 and the counterflange 38 .
positive engagement elements 30 , which can for example be configured as claws engaging in corresponding depressions or as end serrations , are provided between the intermediate flange 32 and the counterflange 28 .
