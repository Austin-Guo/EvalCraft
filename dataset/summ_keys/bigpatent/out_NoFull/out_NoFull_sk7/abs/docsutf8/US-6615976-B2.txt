the truck includes an endless thrower belt 12 , that is attached to the vehicle and is supported by a frame 50 .
the truck includes a drive means ( not shown ) to power the belt so as to move particulate material ( not shown ) deposited onto the belt from the truck bed 14 or from a hopper .
material may be deposited onto the belt directly from the truck bed 14 or an additional conveyor 54 may operate between the truck bed 14 and the belt 12 to transfer the material .
the apparatus includes an endless belt 16 located above the thrower belt 12 and adjacent to the outlet of the truck bed or hopper 14 .
in a preferred embodiment the endless belt 16 is approximately the same width as the thrower belt 12 .
in one embodiment , the endless belt 16 has ribs 30 located on the outer surface thereof and that run transverse to the direction of travel 32 .
when the thrower belt 12 is in motion it drives the endless belt 16 as a result of the frictional engagement between the belts 12 and 16 .
