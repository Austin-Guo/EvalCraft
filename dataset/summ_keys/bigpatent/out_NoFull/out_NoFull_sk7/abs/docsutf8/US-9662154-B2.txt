the shaft of the pin 1 is generally cylindrical in shape .
the proximal end 14 may be curved in a lateral posterior direction , while the distal end 15 may be straight or at least partly straight .
the length of the distal straight section may correspond to the depth to which the distal pin end penetrates into the distal spongiosa structure .
a lateral opening 2 for the intramedullary pin approximately coincides with the insertion direction of the antegrade screw .
if only one screw is set proximally , no further skin incision is therefore necessary .
a feature of the configuration of the three bores lies in the combination of the possibilities for locking .
in addition to the generally known standard locking , the third bore 8 is present between the two standard bores .
