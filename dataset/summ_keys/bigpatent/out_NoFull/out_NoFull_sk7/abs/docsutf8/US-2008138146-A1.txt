the reservoir may take any shape known or later discovered in the art .
attachment means 14 serves as a conduit for the material from the reservoir and may be of any means known or later discovered .
presently the preferred means would be either a threaded interface , a clip on interface or means by which the tip attachment is made integral with the reservoir ( i .
the tip is one part of a tool assembly with the reservoir ) .
in operation , positive pressure is applied to the reservoir to force material through the attachment means 14 .
