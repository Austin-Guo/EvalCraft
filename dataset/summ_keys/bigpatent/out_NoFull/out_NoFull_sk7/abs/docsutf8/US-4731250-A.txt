as can be seen from fig1 the arrangement consists of two endless bands 1 which are assumed here to be steel bands but which may also be other , preferably thermally conducting , bands or reinforced plastic bands .
the parts of the steel bands 1 facing one another form a gap 19 and the size of this gap is determined by supporting or guiding surfaces 11 over which the steel bands 1 are conducted .
the arrangement is also provided with a pumping device 5 which in the case shown here is a peristaltic pump , that is to say a pump which by means of periodical contractions forces the pumped object to advance through a duct .
the compression rollers 7 are controlled so that they compress the steel bands 1 with great force against one another which means that the tube 3 will be closed tightly in the compression region 10 .
hence the pumping arrangement 5 functions so that at least one pair of rollers 7 is always in engagement with one another .
the flattened tube 3 filled with pressurized product 6 is now introduced into a heating zone v , where heat is supplied to such an extent that the product is heated to approx .
in the example given here , heat is supplied by providing magnetic induction coils 12 in the supporting elements 11 of the steel bands 1 .
