as the source of enzymes for mashing , and because of its decisive influence on the characteristic taste of beer , barley malt is the one indespensable brewing material .
malting is simply the controlled germination of grain , the germination being stopped at a desired stage by means of heat .
the purpose of malting the barley is to develop the dormant enzymes of the barley so that they can break down the carbohydrates and release the fermentable sugars .
in other countries , for example the united states of america , adjuncts , such as corn grits or flakes or rice or other materials having high percentages of fermentables , can be added .
corn flakes , having been subjected to pre gelatinization , require no further boiling but can be added directly to the mash .
the cycle is normally divided into steps to allow various enzymes to act at the temperatures best suited to such actions .
one of the reasons for using barley is that the structure of the barley husks makes the bed of spent barley grains especially suitable as a filter .
