in an electron beam lithography process the area to be exposed is divided into a two dimensional array of squares , known as pixels , and the electron beam can be controlled to expose only selected pixels to generate a desired circuit pattern .
in a raster scan type of lithography machine , the pixels are scanned a row at a time and the beam is turned on only while pixels which are to be exposed by the electron beam are being scanned .
because the current density of the beam is approximately gaussian , so too is the forward scattered energy distribution .
likewise , the distribution drops off fast enough that there is substantial overlap only between distributions in adjacent pixels .
the coordinate axes in that figure are selected so that the top surface of the resist lies in the x y plane .
the resist pattern is generated by exposing the resist with an electron beam which typically impinges essentially perpendicular to the resist surface although it could impinge at another angle if desired .
indeed , the beam is guided over the wafer by deflecting it at a deflection point so that the angle of incidence of the beam on the wafer varies by about 2 degrees as the beam scans across the wafer .
