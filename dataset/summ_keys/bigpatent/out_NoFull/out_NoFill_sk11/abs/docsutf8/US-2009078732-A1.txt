the part of the tow bar 1 that joins to the back of the associated vehicle ( not depicted ) is drawn as ragged to distinguish it from the free end which is furthest from the back of the vehicle and has a rounded outline .
in the following description the term “ front ” applies to being nearer to the vehicle and the term “ rear ” applies to being further away from the vehicle to which the tow bar 1 is attached .
the bottom face of the anchoring plate 9 is flat to engage the flat upper face of the tow bar 1 .
the rear of the anchoring plate 9 is shaped to lie within the outline of the rear of the tow bar 1 .
the dimensions of anchoring plate 9 are therefore set to ensure that when holes 8 and 2 align the front edge of anchoring plate 9 does not extend forward of the place , if any , where the tow bar 1 starts to bend upward .
if this requirement is not met the flat anchoring plate 9 is distorted when the securing nut 7 is tightened and the flange 4 acts to bend the anchoring plate 9 into a contour that matches the angled section of the tow bar 1 .
the shape of the lugs 10 and 11 is such that they do not interfere with a spanner tightening the securing nut 7 on the stem 5 after it has passed through the hole 8 and the hole 2 .
the inability of the anchoring plate 9 to rotate on the axis of the stem 5 is retained even if the securing nut 7 is not tight enough to generate sufficient friction between the anchoring plate 9 and the tow bar 1 to prevent one turning on the other .
the relevance of this tolerance and possible tilting relates to fitting the device to tow balls 1 which have dimensions which vary slightly from that nominated by the manufacturer .
see below for further details .
tow balls generally have dimensions that are specified by a government authority .
