the sound producing accessory is constructed of a flat strip of thin , flexible plastic material .
the stiffness of the material is such that it can be bent easily by hand but is stiff enough to emit a snappy sound when it is impacted by the spokes of the bicycle wheel .
060 inches ) thick and preferably made from a durable plastic such as polypropylene , high density polyethylene or polyester to withstand constant flexing over a long period of time .
the sound producing accessory 12 is constructed of a single piece of material but consists of four functionally different regions .
the continuation of tubular region 30 as it wraps around fork element 16 is bent outward slightly at the end to form a handle $ 4 to aid in attaching or detaching device 12 from bicycle 10 .
the bicycle fork 16 is wrapped with adhesive backed loop fastener material 24 at the location where the sound producing device 12 is to be attached .
this is also known as velcro brand and supplied as a mate to hook fastener material 26 .
as seen from this example , the semi tubular region 30 can assume various shapes to adapt to different or unusual cross sectional shapes of wheel fork elements , if required .
in fig5 the rectangularly shaped blade 32 has been modified to a tongue shaped blade 38 with angular sides and a rounded end .
many other possibilities exist in varying the width , length and shape of the blade 32 to alter the sound characteristics of the device as well as its visual appeal .
an additional top handle 42 has been added for convenience of installing the device on the bicycle .
