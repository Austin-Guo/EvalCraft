an injection molding device , which has an injection unit 3 which produces plastic melt in conventional manner and injects it into an injection molding die 6 , can be seen in fig1 .
the plastic melt is thus injected from the injection unit 3 into the die 6 along a melt flow path 4 through a machine nozzle .
the molded parts 2 produced therefore have a particularly good surface quality .
provision can be made in that during injection of the melt into the cavity 5 and / or during addition of the fluid , some of the melt flows over into an overflow cavity 8 .
overflow can be controlled or regulated by valve means 9 .
injection of the fluid takes place predominantly via the injection nozzle 10 .
as can be seen , the fluid therefore expands along the melt flow path 4 in the direction of the cavity 5 .
a liquid having high thermal capacity is used according to a particular embodiment of the invention as fluid .
this leads to a very short cycle time , since the liquid can absorb much heat from the plastic melt .
after injecting the liquid , the blocking means 16 are closed , controlled valves , followers or similar can be used here , so that neither melt nor liquid can escape from the cavity .
the predominantly cold liquid withdraws heat from the plastic melt and thus accelerates the solidification process .
