the present invention relates to an exercise kit for use indoors to simulate the exercise and develop the muscles used in participation in cross country skiing outdoors and rowing .
the kit also permits other exercises for the arms and legs .
the kit comprises a main frame 10 which is the shape of an elongate rectangle having longitudinal side members 11 and 12 , opposite end members 14 and 15 and two members 16 and 18 which extend between the end members parallel to said side members 11 and 12 and parallel to each other to define a pair of rails extending lengthwise of the frame .
attached and positioned oblique to the end member 15 is a pair of spaced foot rest pads 20 and 21 .
the spring member 25 , as illustrated , comprises a plurality of horizontally disposed helical tension springs 26 connected at one end to the end member 14 and to a bracket 27 at their other end .
the bracket 27 is connected to one end of a cable 29 which extends through the pulley 22 and about the wheel thereof and through a handle 30 .
the depending flanges 39 of the frame 36 support a pair of transversely extending parallel shafts 40 on each of which is supported rotatably a pair of axially spaced rollers 42 .
the rollers 42 comprise a cylindrical member of metal having radially projecting flanges which guide the rollers 42 and roller members 35 along the rails as shown in fig2 .
a threaded rod 46 extends through the flanges 39 of the frame 36 and has a lock nut 47 to restrict displacement of the same .
a knurled handle 48 is fixed on the other end .
one plate 50 is fixed to a threaded nut 52 and moves along the rod upon rotation thereof , and the other plate 49 is urged against the rib 45 by a compression spring 53 .
