a hitch bracket 14 is attached at the juncture of the two arms 12 , 13 and extends outwardly therefrom for attachment to the towing vehicle .
the frame 11 may be formed of any suitable rigid substance and is preferably formed from a ready work material such as iron or mild steel .
the frame may have mounting brackets 16 attached at respective ends , formed of any suitable material and typically formed of the same material as the frame 11 .
the mounting brackets may be adapted to facilitate attachment to a particular vehicle , and as such the structure of the vehicle will dictate the exact spacing and shape of the mounting brackets .
in some instances , it is preferable to forgo the mounting brackets 16 , as illustrated in fig2 and attach the towing hitch 10 directly to the bumper , with this variation , the hitch frame is directly attached to the vehicle using bolts or other suitable fastening means .
extending oppositely from the mounting brackets 16 and disposed at the ends of a frame crossbar 15 are the arm brackets .
the arm brackets each consist of an outer bracket 17 and an inner bracket 18 .
the outer brackets 17 are located at the respective ends of the frame crossbar 15 and the inner brackets 18 are located a short distance inwardly therebetween .
passing between and connecting each set of arm brackets 17 , 18 are the first arm pivots 19 which are located on a common center and essentially parallel to the frame crossbar 15 .
a storage shelf 21 is attached to the frame crossbar 15 at its lower portion and centrally .
the shelf 21 extends outwardly from the frame crossbar 15 a distance slightly less than the width of the second arm 13 .
