with reference now to the drawings , the preferred embodiment of the application tool is herein described .
with reference to fig1 , the tool comprises a tip attachment 10 which is attachable to a reservoir that holds the material prior to dispensation .
the reservoir may take any shape known or later discovered in the art .
attachment means 14 serves as a conduit for the material from the reservoir and may be of any means known or later discovered .
presently the preferred means would be either a threaded interface , a clip on interface or means by which the tip attachment is made integral with the reservoir ( i .
the tip is one part of a tool assembly with the reservoir ) .
in operation , positive pressure is applied to the reservoir to force material through the attachment means 14 .
this listing is not intended to be exhaustive and any means of providing positive pressure to the reservoir is to be considered within the scope of the invention .
the selection of a pressurizing means will be dependent on the scale of the invention in its use , from a micro sized , unit dose application to a larger industrial application .
as such , the illustrated means of providing positive pressure are merely examples and not an exhaustive list .
other means are considered well known and numerous in the art and the application of such means so obvious that the illustration of such abundant means is superfluous .
