referring to the drawings , fig1 shows the dental tray of the present invention , generally indicated at 10 , to include two u shaped portions , a lower portion 12 for treating the lower dentition and an upper portion 14 for treating the upper dentition .
the two portions are connected adjacent their posterior ends by a bridging strap 16 which forms a hinge when the tray is in use .
as best shown in fig2 each tray portion consists of an outer shell or substrate 18 , preferably made in a single piece by vacuum forming from a soft polyethlene foam .
bonded to the interior of the shell is a soft hydrophilic foam lining 20 .
the bonding can be accomplished by an suitable means such as with a chemical bonding agent .
however , it is preferred that the hydrophilic foam layer 20 be heat bonded to substrate 18 so as to eliminate any harmful effects from migrating chemicals or leaching of bonding agents .
while the entire tray of the present invention is formed in one integral piece , the various components of each tray portion will be described herein as separate elements to simplify the description thereof .
it should also be understood that these separately described elements each include the outer polyethlene foam shell or substrate 18 bonded , preferably by heat bonding , to the hydrophilic foam lining 20 so as to form a laminated structure .
each base adjacent the posterior end is substantially flat ( fig4 ) to accommodate the relatively flat molars shown in dotted line which are found at this portion of the dental arch .
this allows the trays to properly accommodate the short teeth found generally in the posterior region and the longer canine and incisors found in the anterior portion .
the strap 16 which connects the upper and lower tray portions is a relatively thin strip of the tray material which extends from and connects the upper edges of rear walls 34 and 36 adjacent the buccal walls of each tray ( fig1 ) .
