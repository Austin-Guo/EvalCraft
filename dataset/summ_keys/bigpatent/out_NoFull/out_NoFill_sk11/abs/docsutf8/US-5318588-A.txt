our invention concerns the use of a radially expandable tubular element in the construction of medical devices containing tubular components and / or channels .
in particular , our invention concerns the use of the tubular elements in the construction of device components and channels that function to conduct or convey medical instruments and / or guidewires therethrough .
the use of radially expandable tubular elements in the construction of delivery catheters enables their manufacture with lower composite profiles relative to prior art device delivery catheters of comparable delivery capacity .
the use of radially expandable guidewire channels in the construction of exchangeable guidewire directed diagnostic / therapeutic devices enables their manufacture with lower shaft profiles than heretofore possible .
the luminal profile of shaft section 7 is sufficient to accommodate the profile of the largest device intended for delivery therethrough .
this circumstance enables the construction of shaft sections 5 and 6 with lower external profiles relative to shaft section 7 .
the shaft of the device contains at least two layers ; an inner relatively inelastic layer and an outer relatively elastic layer .
in the preferred embodiment , a lubricous coating is applied to the outer layer to facilitate the introduction and withdrawal of the device within the confines of the body .
this design permits the construction of a shaft that is particularly flexible at the distal end and yet relatively rigid at the proximal end .
our invention further permits the construction of a similar structure wherein the transition in rigidity occurs gradually .
we achieve this variable flexibility by a co tapered extrusion of the inner and outer tubular elements .
