the shaft of the pin 1 is generally cylindrical in shape .
the proximal end 14 may be curved in a lateral posterior direction , while the distal end 15 may be straight or at least partly straight .
the length of the distal straight section may correspond to the depth to which the distal pin end penetrates into the distal spongiosa structure .
a lateral opening 2 for the intramedullary pin approximately coincides with the insertion direction of the antegrade screw .
if only one screw is set proximally , no further skin incision is therefore necessary .
a feature of the configuration of the three bores lies in the combination of the possibilities for locking .
in addition to the generally known standard locking , the third bore 8 is present between the two standard bores .
by locking the pin with three screws , axial stability is achieved .
this ensures that the position of the distal pin end is fixed and the pin can not be displaced on the screws .
the 25 Â° angle of the axial blocking screw may prevent the screw from injuring important soft tissues during insertion .
the locking screws may be present at a distance of about 30 mm away from one another .
