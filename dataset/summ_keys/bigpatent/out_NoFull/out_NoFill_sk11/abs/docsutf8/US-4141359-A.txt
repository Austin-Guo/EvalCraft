this invention pertains to an iontophoresis device for general topical application of ionic drugs to high impedance low mucous tissue such as epidermis .
circuitry and physical configuration have been developed to ensure safe operation and to provide simplified procedures which require minimal training and technical ability .
additional convenience circuits are discussed which facilitate simplified procedures of administration .
inasmuch as the rate of flow of the ionic drug into the tissue is proportional to the current flow , the current should be regulated at the maximum constant level within the limits of safety and comfort in order to minimize treatment time .
many of the hazards previously experienced by iontophoresis treatments have resulted by reason of this wide range of impedance .
the exact current density required will depend upon the thickness of the epidermis and the sensitivity of the patient to the applied voltage .
under certain conditions tissue resistance can be as high as 300k , such as where surface contact between the electrode and tissue is poor and where the tissue is dry and clean .
by using an ionic gel as the conducting medium , the irregular surface of the epidermis can be fully contacted , thereby increasing the area of exposure and maximizing electrical contact with the tissue .
the resultant decrease in impedance to a more favorable range of 10k to 50k reduces the voltage requirement and improves the realization of a safe and painless iontophoresis treatment .
it will therefore be noted that the use of a conductive gel is imperative for safe and painless iontophoresis of epidermal tissue .
economic considerations of administration time versus material costs become the dominant factor in establishing the percent solution desired .
