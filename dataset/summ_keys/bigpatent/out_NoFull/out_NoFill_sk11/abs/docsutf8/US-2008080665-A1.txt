there are herein described methods and apparatus useful for imaging systems such as , for example , but not limited to an x ray system .
the apparatus and methods are illustrated with reference to the figures wherein similar numbers indicate the same elements in all figures .
such figures are intended to be illustrative rather than limiting and are included herewith to facilitate explanation of an exemplary embodiment of the apparatus and methods of the invention .
in this disclosure , methods and apparatus are described that will enable the measurement of the absolute temperature seen by each pixel in an array of diodes used in a multislice ct detector .
the measurement setup can however be extended to any diode system .
this becomes even more critical when more than 64 slices are used , and when thinner slices are built .
currently , the temperature drift from calibration to imaging stations has to be maintained within a few degrees .
one can envision measuring the temperature of the pixel at which it has been calibrated and storing it in a look up table for later use .
knowing the response of the diode scintillator pixel at different temperatures would enable the correction of image quality drift due to temperature .
this will enable at the same time the relaxation of the thermal management of both the detector and the gantry .
the challenge to make this correction possible is to find an innovative method to measure the temperature of the pixel before each scan and use the value for correction of the diode response .
