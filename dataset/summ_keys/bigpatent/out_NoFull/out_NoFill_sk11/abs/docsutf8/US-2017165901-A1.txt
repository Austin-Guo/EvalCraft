fig1 shows a perspective view of an embodiment of a soft contact lens package 1 ( generally representing an ophthalmic lens package ) which is of a blister package type .
in the closed state the soft contact lens package 1 , the base part 2 and the cover film 3 are tightly bonded together along the bonding area 7 , so that neither liquid nor gases can escape from or enter into the depression 4 where the contact lens 5 immersed in the liquid 6 is stored .
the bonding area 7 is located on a portion of the flange 8 which extends outwardly from the depression 4 in a planar manner , and is located directly adjacent to the depression 4 .
such a base part 2 can be produced very reliably and is inexpensive to manufacture .
in addition , such a plastic base part 2 is suitable for thermal bonding without the need to add any additional bonding material ( glue , adhesive or the like ) before thermally bonding the cover film 3 and the base part 2 .
the ophthalmic lens 5 is placed into the depression and the liquid 6 is dispensed into the depression 4 before thermally bonding the base part 2 and the cover film 3 together .
the cover film 3 may comprise a plurality of layers , for example it may comprise seven layers .
they can be produced using lamination techniques .
that layer of the cover film 3 facing the base part 2 may comprise one or more plastics suitable for thermally bonding together the cover film 3 and the base part 2 .
the package holder 9 may be used for thermally bonding the cover film 3 to the base part 2 but is not limited to being used for the bonding operation only , but rather may be used in additional operations during the packaging process .
the shape of the support structure upper surface 12 essentially corresponds to the shape of the bonding area 7 .
