a tool spindle 2 extends out of the end of the housing of a drill hammer 1 , which end is on the side of the workpiece and is only shown in part .
the tool spindle 2 transmits a torque on the one hand and axial strokes , on the other hand , to a tool receptacle 3 which is securely connected with it .
two recesses 7 which are closed in the axial direction at both sides are arranged at the tool shaft 5 so as to be located opposite one another on a diagonal line ; assigned locking bodies 8 of the tool holder 3 are constructed as balls to engage in the recesses 7 .
as can be seen in fig2 the slot or groove like recesses 7 have a circular cylindrical cross sectional shape .
as can be seen in fig2 the rotary driving grooves 9 are situated so as to be offset at different angles relative to the recesses 7 .
the rotary driving grooves 9 have two planar flanks 10 which extend at least approximately radially and cooperate with assigned surfaces of strip shaped rotary drivers 11 which are arranged at the cylindrical inner wall of the receptacle bore hole 4 of the tool receptacle 3 .
the front portion of the drill 6 located in the front of the tool shaft 5 is constructed in a conventional manner , a view of the latter being omitted in the drawing for this reason .
a portion of the drill 6 which contains a conveying spiral for carrying away drillings knocked loose from the drilling head adjoins a drillings head comprising carbide cutting edges .
very favorable conditions result from the planar flanks 10 , which extend at least approximately radially , and the assigned surfaces of the strip shaped rotary drivers 11 , since the forces to be transmitted are approximately normal on the cooperating surfaces .
the force transmission always occurs even in the state of advanced wear at surfaces and not ultimately at the edges of the recesses .
the recess 7 arranged in the tool shaft 5 serve only for the axial locking of the drill shaft in the tool receptacle 3 .
