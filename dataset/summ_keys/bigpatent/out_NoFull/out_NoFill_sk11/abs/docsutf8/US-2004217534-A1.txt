with reference first to fig1 there is illustrated one preferred embodiment for use of the concepts of this invention .
upper bundle plane 26 , preferably , is constructed of any suitable , durable material that is capable of allowing the bundle to be held upon upper bundle plane 26 and traverse along upper bundle plane 26 .
clamping jaws 32 , preferably , are constructed of any suitable , durable , rigid material that is capable of clamping the bundle in order to retain the spine of the bundle .
carriage centering rollers 34 , preferably , are any suitable rollers that are capable of traversing spine form roller 38 along the spine of the bundle .
spine form roller 38 , preferably , is any suitable v shaped roller that is capable of traversing along the spine of the bundle in order to flatten the spine .
carriage drive screw 40 and drive nut 42 , preferably , can be any conventional drive screw and drive nut that are capable of driving spine form roller 38 along the spine of the bundle .
fig2 more clearly shows how the various elements interact with each other .
it is to be understood that media 3 can be any suitable media upon which printing or other similar types of imaging can be placed .
as shown in fig3 bundle clamp 5 is conventionally moved to a downward or closed position to allow media 3 to come into contact with drive rollers 10 .
in this manner , when the spine of bundle 50 is formed and flattened , the various media sheets of bundle 50 will align to form a straightedge , thereby resembling a booklet .
as a sheet of media 3 is introduced on to bundle 50 , the leading sheet edge of media 3 is conventionally monitored so that when leading sheet edge of media 3 reaches a desired point along bundle 50 , bundle clamp 14 is lowered or closed on to the sheet of media 3 and drive rollers 10 creates a trailing edge buckle that causes the trailing end of the sheet of media 3 to position itself at the other end ( trailing end ) of bundle 50 .
