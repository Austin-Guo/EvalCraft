fig2 depicts the probe vibrator and head that is used in one embodiment of the present invention .
probe head 201 is comprised of one or many small metal plates that each have a surface area of 0 .
each plate is connected to a low noise current to voltage ( i / v ) converter housed within the probe head 201 and a copper shield held at the reference potential surrounds the entire head .
the vibrator unit 209 is designed to move the probe head along a single axis that is perpendicular to the surface of the skin or epithelia under study .
this can be achieved with many types of vibrators based on piezoelectric , magnetostrictive or electromagnetic transducers .
the computer 301 has an analogue to digital converter that is used to acquire signals from the probe and determines the peak to peak voltage variation on each current to voltage converter connected to each metal sensor as it vibrates near the epithelium .
on the upper left corner , the probe real time output is displayed and several acquisition parameters such as the desired acquisition rate and number of loops to average is entered there .
the desired frequency of vibration is entered in the upper center box and the scanning parameters are entered on the upper right box .
the time course of both the averaged voltage and slope are displayed on the lower left panel .
the motorized positioner is capable of moving with a 1 Î¼m step size in each direction .
as can be seen in fig6 , the method of measuring the electric field near a wound on a mammal is detailed .
