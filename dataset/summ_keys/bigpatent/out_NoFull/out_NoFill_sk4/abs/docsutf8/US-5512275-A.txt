this present patent application pertains to a use of a coal tar formulation , in combination with other named and related ingredients to help sustain the hair shaft & # 39 ; s growth cycle in the anagen phase and assist in the formation of new shafts .
the exact mechanism by which this is accomplished is not known by the inventor , however , the medicinal affects of coal tar for the treatment of psoriasis have been well established , as discussed above , and are known to have a metabolic effect on skin cells , including the epidermal layer of the scalp .
the remaining ingredients assist in the delivery of the liquor carbonis detergens to the dermal papilla by acting as fat / oil emollients , stimulants , and other supporting agents as discussed below .
it is hypothesized that any one of several biochemical cellular and molecular disturbances that occur during the anagen phase or catagen phase of subjects with androgenic alopecia are corrected or improved metabolically either in the functioning or formation of the stem cells , their migration process or during the mitosis phase of keratin production within the follicular papilla and matrix .
