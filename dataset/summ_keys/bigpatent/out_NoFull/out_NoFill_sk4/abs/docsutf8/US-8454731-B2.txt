embodiments of the invention are directed to vapor liquid contacting apparatuses comprising a primary contacting ( e .
, natural gas comprising predominantly methane ) , the primary absorption zone can achieve the bulk or main removal of these contaminants , while the secondary absorption zone can serve as a “ finishing ” or “ polishing ” zone to more completely purify the impure gas .
the apparatuses and methods of vapor and liquid contacting described herein may be used in any vapor liquid contacting application , and especially offshore applications , for example , when installed on a floating vessel or platform .
in such cases , vapor liquid contacting is susceptible to inefficiencies resulting from horizontal motion of the apparatus ( e .
