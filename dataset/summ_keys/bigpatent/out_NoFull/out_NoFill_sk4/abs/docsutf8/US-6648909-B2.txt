referring now to fig1 the subject invention is a device 10 for applying thermal therapy to the perineal or rectal area of a patient .
in the preferred embodiment , the thermal treatment is produced through a chemical reaction of two chemical compounds which , when mixed , produce either an endothermic or exothermic reaction .
it is desirable to use a fluid impervious material because it allows the maximum amount of thermal therapy to be available to a patient .
if the outer shell 14 is a fluid absorbent material , the fluid absorbed in the material will tend to act as an insulator against the cold or heat therapy and will reduce the effectiveness of the device 10 .
