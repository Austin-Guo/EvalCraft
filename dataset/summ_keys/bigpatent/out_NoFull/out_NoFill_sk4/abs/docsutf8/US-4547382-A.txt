as the source of enzymes for mashing , and because of its decisive influence on the characteristic taste of beer , barley malt is the one indespensable brewing material .
malting is simply the controlled germination of grain , the germination being stopped at a desired stage by means of heat .
the purpose of malting the barley is to develop the dormant enzymes of the barley so that they can break down the carbohydrates and release the fermentable sugars .
in other countries , for example the united states of america , adjuncts , such as corn grits or flakes or rice or other materials having high percentages of fermentables , can be added .
