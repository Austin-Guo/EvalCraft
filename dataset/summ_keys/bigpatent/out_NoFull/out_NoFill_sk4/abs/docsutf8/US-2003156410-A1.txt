the design of the present invention is so effective that in some models , the number of led & # 39 ; s required for each assembly is only one quarter of those required in existing led cluster models .
the inner reflective surface of these conical depressions 24 have interruptions 26 , so as to form a non uniform reflective surface .
although the depressions 24 are illustrated as being generally conical , it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the depressions can have other configurations as well .
the important aspect of the present invention is that the depressions 24 have such interruptions 26 so as to maximize the reflective surface thereof .
