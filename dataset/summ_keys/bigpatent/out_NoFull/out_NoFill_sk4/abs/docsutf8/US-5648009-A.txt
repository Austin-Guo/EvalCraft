the spaces between partition plates , such as plates 26 , 28 , provide cavities into which wet cement is compressed and thereafter stripped therefrom to form a molded concrete product .
an alignment pin , such as pin 58 shown in fig2 is mounted on the end bracket at each corner portion and an alignment bore , such as bore 60 , coaxial with the pin , is formed on the side beam .
the bores are sized and positioned so that , when each bore has its associated alignment pin therein , the mold box support frame is sufficiently aligned to form molded products , all as more fully described in my u .
the other retractor , not visible in the drawings , is located at the opposite end of mold box assembly 10 and is substantially identical to retractor 90 .
