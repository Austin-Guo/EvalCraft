referring to fig1 , a scanning electron micrograph of a length of suture 2 according to the present invention is shown .
due to the transparent nature of the uhmwpe , the suture takes on the color of strands 10 and 12 , and thus appears to be white with a trace in the contrasting color .
in accordance with the present invention , trace strands 12 are preferably provided in black .
the black trace assists surgeons in distinguishing between suture lengths with the trace and suture lengths without the trace .
