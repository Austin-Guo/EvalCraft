as will be more fully described hereinbelow , the accessory is adapted for attachment to standard skateboards which are in widespread use today .
the platform member is preferably shaped in the form of a disc .
this configuration is desirable inasmuch as the circular platform presents the same platform area to the operator regardless of the angular disposition of the platform .
of course , the platform could be shaped in other configurations , as for example , elongated , but the operator would then have to properly position the platform prior to or simultaneously with mounting the skateboard .
