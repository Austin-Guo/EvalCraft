with reference now to the drawing , and considering all the figures simultaneously , for purposes of explanation a cigarette packaging machine has been depicted .
the cigarettes 10 to be packaged in this machine are received on a feed belt 11 .
the cigarettes are delivered to the packaging machine in a direction transverse to their axial length and are conveyed into a pair of hoppers 12 and 13 .
an auxiliary feed belt 12 assists in the distribution of the cigarettes into the two hoppers .
the hoppers 12 and 13 feed directly into chutes 15 and 16 which are provided with plural intermediate walls 17 for the purpose of forming side by side rows of superimposed cigarettes .
the rams 18 preferably engage the filter ends 19 of the cigarettes in the case where filter tip cigarettes are being packaged .
the block turntable 22 may , for example , have six divisions with each division comprising a pair of cells .
in passing from the chutes into the cells , the cigarettes are forced through a restricted opening 23 which urges the cigarettes closer together thus compensating for the removal of the partitions 17 of the chutes .
the fact that some cells are empty after the first revolution of turntable 22 , on start up of the machine , may be taken into account in the operation of the wrapping apparatus located downstream of the block turntable in the direction of product movement .
