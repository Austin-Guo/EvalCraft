the design of the present invention is so effective that in some models , the number of led & # 39 ; s required for each assembly is only one quarter of those required in existing led cluster models .
the inner reflective surface of these conical depressions 24 have interruptions 26 , so as to form a non uniform reflective surface .
although the depressions 24 are illustrated as being generally conical , it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the depressions can have other configurations as well .
the important aspect of the present invention is that the depressions 24 have such interruptions 26 so as to maximize the reflective surface thereof .
the lens 28 is preferably comprised of ultraviolet stabilized lexan or other appropriate glass or plastic material .
as can be seen from this illustration , the domes 38 arch above the otherwise planar surface of the lens 28 .
each dome 38 includes ridges 42 which encircle each dimple lens 40 in a concentric fashion so that each ridge 42 is spaced from the adjoining ridge .
another advantage of the dome configuration of the lens 28 is that it significantly increases the overall strength of the lens 28 so that it resists breakage .
such breakage typically occurs in conventional automobile lights when the automobile strikes another object , such as another car , or loose objects on the road strike the lenses .
