referring now to fig1 the subject invention is a device 10 for applying thermal therapy to the perineal or rectal area of a patient .
in the preferred embodiment , the thermal treatment is produced through a chemical reaction of two chemical compounds which , when mixed , produce either an endothermic or exothermic reaction .
it is desirable to use a fluid impervious material because it allows the maximum amount of thermal therapy to be available to a patient .
if the outer shell 14 is a fluid absorbent material , the fluid absorbed in the material will tend to act as an insulator against the cold or heat therapy and will reduce the effectiveness of the device 10 .
it is also desirable to use a pliant material to maximize the comfort of the device 10 , since it is being placed against sensitive tissue .
therefore , it is highly desirable for the outer shell 14 not to include rough edges .
other materials which may be used to form the pouch 24 include biaxially oriented nylon laminated to linear low density polyethylene ( lldpe ) and straight polyethylene .
when the rupturable wall 36 is ruptured , the first and second chemicals 30 , 34 are allowed to mix to cause either an endothermic or exothermic reaction to occur .
when heat therapy is desired , the first chemical 30 may be taken from the group consisting of sodium acetate and sodium thiosulfate , and the second chemical 34 may be taken from the group consisting of borax and aluminum oxide so that when the first and second chemicals 30 , 34 are exposed , an exothermic chain reaction occurs .
