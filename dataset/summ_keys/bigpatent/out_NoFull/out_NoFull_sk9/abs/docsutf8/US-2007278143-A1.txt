fig1 a 1 d depict one aspect of the invention , which includes at least one low profile , relatively compact bowl shaped container 10 for use at an industrial site that produces a waste product , such as sludge .
the container 10 may be buried in the ground or , alternatively , may be above ground and associated with a suitable support structure , if necessary , to ensure stability .
still another option is to associate the container 10 with a vehicle v , such as a flatbed truck or trailer ( see fig1 d ) , such that it may be easily transported from one site to another and thus becomes portable .
as noted above , the container 10 is bowl shaped , upstanding and preferably generally hemispherical with an open compartment or chamber 12 for receiving the product to be dried ( i .
in a preferred embodiment of the invention , the chamber 12 is open at the top , and has a diameter of about ten feet or less .
the container 10 can be made of any suitably strong material resistant to leaking and to reaction with the corresponding product .
examples of materials from which the container 10 may be constructed include concrete , plastic , steel , or other metal , with a preference for aluminum or stainless steel ( primarily due to the superior corrosion resistance afforded ) .
specifically , the container 10 may comprise prefabricated components of a size that permits easy transport to the industrial site .
if warranted by the projected rate of waste product produced by the industrial site , multiple chambers may be used .
