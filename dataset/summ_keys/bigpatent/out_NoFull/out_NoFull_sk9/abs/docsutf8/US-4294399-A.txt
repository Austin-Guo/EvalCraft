fig1 discloses the principle of the present invention by showing the closure of one corner of a unitary folding cigarette box wherein stationary locking means 4 contain rotating locking means 8 in the same plane when the cap 6 is in a closed position .
these cutting lines are shown substantially linearly for the greater portion , but alternatively they could also be curved in one or the opposite direction .
alternatively they could be formed by a pair of angular or perpendicular cutting lines , e .
, by a first cutting line portion which forms a linear or angular extension of the folding line 28 and 29 respectively and a second cutting line portion extending towards the upper wall 20 .
the important feature is that the cutting lines define locking means in the planes of the walls .
this cutting line 54 is shown as a linear line but alternatively could also be curved .
it is essential that the radius of the end portion of the inwardly extending side wall portion of the rotating locking means be greater than a radius drawn to a portion of the stationary locking means to effect a butting surface .
in accordance with this construction in the beginning phase of the opening operation through the rotation of the cap 26 the rotating locking means 66 , 68 abut against the inner surface of the stationary locking means 64 , 64 thus preventing a further opening movement of the cap .
upon further force and rotation of the cap the resilient side wall portions may spread or bulge .
