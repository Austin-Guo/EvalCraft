as will be more fully described hereinbelow , the accessory is adapted for attachment to standard skateboards which are in widespread use today .
the platform member is preferably shaped in the form of a disc .
this configuration is desirable inasmuch as the circular platform presents the same platform area to the operator regardless of the angular disposition of the platform .
of course , the platform could be shaped in other configurations , as for example , elongated , but the operator would then have to properly position the platform prior to or simultaneously with mounting the skateboard .
the ease of such alignment would be greatly facilitated by practice and operator skill , so that this disadvantage would perhaps be of minimal importance to a skilled operator .
the use of an elongated platform member would have the advantage of allowing increased leverage to be applied to tilt the skateboard while turning , and of course , the rotatable aspect of the platform would allow the operator to swivel while riding .
the platform member may be fabricated from a rigid plastic , wood , metal , or other durable rigid material capable of withstanding the stresses inherent in skateboarding .
the thickness of the platform is determined by the material used ; it is necessary that the platform have sufficient strength for safe operation , and also be attachable to the bearing means by conventional fasteners , such as screws .
upper surface 31 and lower surface 32 are formed together to prevent loss of bearing balls 35 when the accessory is tipped or subjected to stresses tending to separate the surfaces 31 and 32 .
