the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings .
an apparatus according to the present invention will be described referring to fig1 .
reference numeral 1 designates a bale for cellulose ester fibers and numeral 2 designates a tow drawn from the bale 1 .
reference numeral 3 denotes a preliminary tow opening device for producing a filter rod having a uniform filtration efficiency from the tow 2 .
the periphery of the tow 2 is then wrapped with a continuous endless belt 9 made of material through which microwave energy can easily penerate and the tow is passed through a microwave applicator 10 .
it is necessary that water be provided to the filter rod during the microwave process .
the filter rod is rapidly cured by the water contained in the filter rod and by carboxylic acid ester of polyol to thereby provide a filter rod having a stabilized shape .
the final filter rod is cut by cutter to a predetermined length .
otherwise , it is possible to provide at an inlet or an intermediate position of the applicator a device for feeding vaporized moisture to the fibrous rods .
