referring to the drawings , wherein like components may be indicated by like reference numbers throughout the various figures , fig1 illustrates one embodiment of an ethanol production facility , generally indicated by the reference number 100 .
the enzymes break down starch in the feedstock into simple sugars and the resulting mixture is referred to herein as a mash .
once the sugar has been produced , yeast is added to the mash and the mash ferments in the fermentation tank until the sugars in the feedstock are converted to ethanol and carbon dioxide .
the solids are at least partially dissolved in the water and can include remaining feedstock material along with residual sugars , yeast and yeast waste .
in this embodiment , the distillant flows into distillation tank 106 where it runs down to the bottom of the tank and collects in pool 112 .
at this point , the distillant is heated by a heating coil 114 that is submerged in pool 112 and which forms a first portion of a heat transfer tubing 115 .
the condenser condenses the ethanol and passes the condensed ethanol to a storage tank 122 through a condenser tube 124 where the ethanol is stored for later use .
the remaining water can be removed from the ethanol by further steps that are not shown .
in the present example , distillation tank 106 is constructed with a double wall structure with a refractory material in between the two walls .
