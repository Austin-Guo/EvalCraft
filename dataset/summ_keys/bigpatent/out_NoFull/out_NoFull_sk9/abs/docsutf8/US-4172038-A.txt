the partition 6 has cutouts , in which tubes 8 are arranged parallel to the axis of the tube in a pressure tight manner .
the tubes 8 are arranged in the cross section of the housing 1 in such a manner that as many tubes as possible can be accommodated .
their outer circumferential surface is the circumferential entrance surface .
the filter bodies 9 themselves are tubular and are closed off by plugs 11 at their ends facing the cover 3 .
at their outer circumference , the filter bodies 9 have a helical groove 12 , which forms a helical canal for the liquid between the filter body 9 and the inner circumference of the tube 8 .
the liquid can enter the canal at the inlet 13 located at the left in fig1 and can leave it again at the outlet 14 located at the right in fig1 .
the partition 6 divides the interior of the pressure housing 1 into a first chamber 18 which according to fig1 is situated to the left and into which the inlet 19 of the pressure housing leads .
as this pressure acts on the inside surface 26 of the tubes 8 as well as on the free outer circumferential surface 28 , the tubes 28 are substantially pressure relieved and can be made accordingly light .
from there , the liquid to be filtered passes through the inlet 13 into the helical groove 12 , moves helically in this groove along the filter body 9 and enters into the chamber 20 at the outlet 14 from the groove .
