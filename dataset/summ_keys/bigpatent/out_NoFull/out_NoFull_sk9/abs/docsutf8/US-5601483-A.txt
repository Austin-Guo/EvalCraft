in fig1 an exemplary embodiment of the invention is labeled in its entirety with the number 10 .
one end of the hollow spindle 24 projects outward from the gear drive housing 12 and is configured as a counterflange 26 with which is associated an external clamping flange 28 to clamp a tool 29 located between them , which in the example shown is a grinding disk .
a quick clamping device which has a tension spindle 36 , coaxial with the hollow spindle 24 , that is joined integrally to the clamping flange 28 is provided in order to allow manual clamping and unclamping of the tool 29 .
the tension spindle 36 can be displaced in the axial direction by means of a displacement unit via a clamping lever 74 that can pivot about an axis 80 .
the pusher element 42 has internal threads 35 into which the tension spindle 36 can be threaded with external threads 33 provided at its upper end .
arranged between the intermediate flange 32 and the outer clamping flange 28 is a spring washer 37 that is depicted in the right half of the tension spindle 36 , compressed between the intermediate flange 32 and the counterflange 38 .
positive engagement elements 30 , which can for example be configured as claws engaging in corresponding depressions or as end serrations , are provided between the intermediate flange 32 and the counterflange 28 .
the disk 54 is configured as a brake disk , since its underside , which is configured as a friction surface 53 , is pressed upon displacement of the pusher stud 52 toward the pusher plate 44 by the pressure of the spring elements 56 onto the end surface 55 of the hollow spindle 24 in order to decelerate the latter .
with the clamping lever 74 in the clamped position 72 as illustrated , the pusher stud 52 has its cam lobe 64 resting against the eccentric element , so that the lower end surface of the pusher stud 52 , which is configured as an additional friction surface 51 facing the pusher plate 44 lying below it , is lifted by the surface of the pusher plate 44 that is also configured as a friction surface 50 .
