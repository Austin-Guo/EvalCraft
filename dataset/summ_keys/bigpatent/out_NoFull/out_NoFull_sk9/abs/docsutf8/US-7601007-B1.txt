the emergency apparatus , constructed according to the present invention and generally designated 10 , is particularly adapted for use with an abandoned travel trailer t having a pre existing electrical wiring harness or system , generally designated 13 , and a draft tongue 11 .
it should be understood that any number of additional or different lighting circuits may be coupled to additional or other lights ( not shown ) such as overhead lamps 86 , can be utilized but are not illustrated herein .
an electrical pigtail connector or coupler , generally designated 19 , is coupled to the trailer wiring , generally designated 13 , and comprises a conventional seven way trailer socket which is well known in the art .
the trailer t includes an emergency braking system which is schematically illustrated as a normally de energized electrical solenoid 31 coupled , via circuit line 23 a electrically connected to ground potential and to a circuit line 23 that is also electrically connected to ground potential and includes a trailer mounted battery 28 and a normally open “ dead man switch ” 29 which is automatically closed when the trailer t is inadvertently unhitched from a draft vehicle v to actuate the brake solenoid 31 .
when the trailer is being towed by a draft vehicle v , the socket coupler 19 is coupled to a complementally formed male coupler or pigtail 19 a on the tow vehicle v as illustrated in chain lines in fig1 .
when the vehicle v and trailer t are unhitched as illustrated in fig1 a , the trailer coupler pigtail 19 is disconnected from the male tow vehicle pigtail 19 a as illustrated in solid lines in fig1 .
the device 40 may suitably comprise electrically nonconductive material such as plastic which will yield to axially receive the mating couplers 60 and 19 , with each having an outside diameter that is equal to or slightly greater than the inside diameter of the sleeve 44 .
the receptacles 17 are schematically illustrated in fig3 as being generally rectangular and in fig4 as including u shaped spring metal blades 70 each having a base leg 71 and a folded over terminal leg 72 which is yieldably urged from the inoperative position , illustrated in chain lines in fig4 , to the operative electrical energizing position , illustrated in solid lines in fig4 , when the socket connector 19 is axially moved into the storage holder 40 and is electrically connected to the mating male connector 60 disposed in the storage device 40 .
the normally open short circuit switch 75 can be manually operated to complete an electrical circuit from the battery 28 and independent circuit line 26 to the trailer lights 12 and 14 via independent circuit lines 16 and 18 so that the lights 12 and 14 can be selectively energized or de energized as necessary and desirable .
