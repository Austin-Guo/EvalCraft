a detailed description of a drive system for a moving walkway formed according to the invention will be made below , and it must be understood that the described concepts are equally applicable to moving stairs and other conveyor systems .
the output shaft of the reducer 3 moves in each case the gear wheel 4 which in turn drives the horizontal drive chains 1 .
these chains carry deformable rollers 5 engaging with opposing housings that the plates 6 of the moving walkway have on the rear surface .
fig4 and 5 show plan and perspective views of a horizontal drive chain horizontal for the drive system of the invention .
the chain includes the rollers 5 , formed from elastically deformable material and also carries arms 10 , aimed in the same direction as the rollers 5 and which will be useful as a drive means for the handrail , as will be described below .
fig6 shows a perspective view of one of the links 11 of the chains 1 with the elastically deformable rollers 5 and the arms 10 , which can be provided with a coating 12 based on materials selected from deformable and resilient materials , the handrail 7 being supported against such coating for its drive by friction , as shown in fig1 .
