the emergency apparatus , constructed according to the present invention and generally designated 10 , is particularly adapted for use with an abandoned travel trailer t having a pre existing electrical wiring harness or system , generally designated 13 , and a draft tongue 11 .
it should be understood that any number of additional or different lighting circuits may be coupled to additional or other lights ( not shown ) such as overhead lamps 86 , can be utilized but are not illustrated herein .
an electrical pigtail connector or coupler , generally designated 19 , is coupled to the trailer wiring , generally designated 13 , and comprises a conventional seven way trailer socket which is well known in the art .
the trailer t includes an emergency braking system which is schematically illustrated as a normally de energized electrical solenoid 31 coupled , via circuit line 23 a electrically connected to ground potential and to a circuit line 23 that is also electrically connected to ground potential and includes a trailer mounted battery 28 and a normally open “ dead man switch ” 29 which is automatically closed when the trailer t is inadvertently unhitched from a draft vehicle v to actuate the brake solenoid 31 .
when the trailer is being towed by a draft vehicle v , the socket coupler 19 is coupled to a complementally formed male coupler or pigtail 19 a on the tow vehicle v as illustrated in chain lines in fig1 .
when the vehicle v and trailer t are unhitched as illustrated in fig1 a , the trailer coupler pigtail 19 is disconnected from the male tow vehicle pigtail 19 a as illustrated in solid lines in fig1 .
