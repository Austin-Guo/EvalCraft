the device 100 may include a first surface 104 having a pair of generally parallel sides spaced by a first predetermined distance d 1 and a second surface 102 having a first region 102 a having generally parallel sides spaced by a second predetermined distance d 2 and a second region 102 b having a first dimension generally corresponding to the first predetermined distance d 1 and a second dimension generally corresponding to the second predetermined distance d 2 .
the second region 102 b maybe referred to as a transition region , where the width of the structure transitions from a wide width to a narrow width or vice versa depending on which end of the structure the canine enters .
the surfaces 102 and 104 may include a plurality of protuberances or raised slats 106 , preferably three fourths of an inch thick and one and half inches wide that preferably extend from edge to edge of the surfaces .
the slats 106 may provide a pushing surface to aid the canine in the ascent or decline of the structure 100 .
the transition in the dimension of the second region 102 b from d 1 to d 2 may be linear or non linear .
the surfaces may have a textured coating to reduce injury to a canine .
