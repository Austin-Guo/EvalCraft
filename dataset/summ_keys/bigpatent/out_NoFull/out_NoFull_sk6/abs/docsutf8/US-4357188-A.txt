the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings .
an apparatus according to the present invention will be described referring to fig1 .
reference numeral 1 designates a bale for cellulose ester fibers and numeral 2 designates a tow drawn from the bale 1 .
reference numeral 3 denotes a preliminary tow opening device for producing a filter rod having a uniform filtration efficiency from the tow 2 .
the periphery of the tow 2 is then wrapped with a continuous endless belt 9 made of material through which microwave energy can easily penerate and the tow is passed through a microwave applicator 10 .
