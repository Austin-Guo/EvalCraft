the general use of probiotic bacteria is in the form of viable cells .
however , it can also be extended to non viable cells such as killed cultures or compositions containing beneficial factors expressed by the probiotic bacteria .
with non viable cells product preparation is simpler , cells may be incorporated easily into pharmaceuticals and storage requirements are much less limited than viable cells .
it is unknown whether intact bacteria are required to exert an immunomodulatory effect or if individual active components of the invention can be utilized alone .
upon isolation of these components , pharmaceutical grade manipulation is anticipated .
this cytokine augments the proliferation and differentiation of b cells into antibody secreting cells .
