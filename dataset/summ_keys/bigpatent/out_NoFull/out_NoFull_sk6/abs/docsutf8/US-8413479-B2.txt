the work piece 24 may be an annular powder metal blank such as a helical gear , a spur gear or the like .
the core rod 22 is located in the central void of the work piece 24 .
the die 12 and the support shaft 18 may also be moved by independent actuators to reduce cycle time .
in addition , automatic component insertion and extraction mechanisms may also be used in the system .
lower core rod portion 38 is preferably made from a material which is resistant to deformation at high temperatures and pressures , such as high temperature steel .
other materials which are resistant to deformation at high temperatures and pressures may also be used .
