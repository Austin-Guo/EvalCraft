moreover , a shaft hub 55 is provided which is connected fixedly in terms of rotation to a turbofan .
the apparatus 1 according to the invention consists of a supply device 2 comprising a tank for the cleaning medium which is suitable for storing liquid carbon dioxide , of a cooling device for cooling this tank and a pump .
the nozzle device 4 has two nozzles 5 through which the cleaning agent can emerge .
the cleaning agent used is liquid carbon dioxide in which flakes are formed shortly after it emerges from the nozzles .
these flakes pass into the engine and because of their low temperature release the dirt from the components of the engine as a result of induced cold / heat stresses .
the engine may in this case rotate in the dry cranking mode .
