at a top of the assembly , articles received from a feeder enter feed tube 2 and fall through an article detecting unit 10 , preferably a light sensing detector of the type according to the aforementioned u .
this arrangement allows for easy , rapid disassembly of the counting head assembly for inspection , cleaning and maintenance without tools , as the front wall 19 may be easily removed from the front of counting head assembly 1 by sliding upwards a short distance and lifting over the retaining pin 21 .
the pressure applied by pin 21 to seal the edges of front wall 19 against the sides of the chamber is preferably adjustable , for example , by use of a threaded pin or pin cap , or , as illustrated in fig1 b , with a bushing and lock ring apparatus 22 at the rear of the chamber which draws the pin towards the rear of the chamber .
the chamber is divided into left and right channels by a center divider 25 , which in this embodiment is located by locating dowels 26 at a rear divider edge , and retained in the chamber at a front divider edge by front wall 19 .
adjacent to the top of center divider 25 is provided an upper diverting gate 30 , which is rotatably mounted on a shaft 31 of a smart servo unit 35 to divert articles falling through detecting unit 10 into one of the left or right channels .
the smart servo 35 includes a high torque electric motor drive , and a processor which allows the unit to determine the rotary position of its shaft 31 .
