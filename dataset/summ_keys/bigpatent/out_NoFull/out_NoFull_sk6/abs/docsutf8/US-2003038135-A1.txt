the container 10 may include a plurality of support members such as loop segments 12 circumferentially disposed around a base member such as a circular rim 14 .
the loop segments 12 may be disposed around rim 14 so that the first distal end 13 of one loop segment 12 overlaps the second distal end 15 of the adjacent loop segment 12 immediately next to it .
a plurality of stoppers 17 may be disposed on the circumference of rim 14 to prevent movement of the distal ends of the loop segments 12 outside a predetermined distance on the rim 14 .
stoppers 17 may be round metal knobs affixed to the rim 14 by any conventional means such as spot welding or soldering , for example .
in one exemplary embodiment , load bearing means 16 are affixed to alternating loop segments 12 and are adapted to receive a portion of an adjacent loop segment 12 when all loop segments 12 are moved to an extended or usable configuration .
in its extended configuration the interior of container 10 defines a volume within which an object may be placed , as best shown in fig6 .
