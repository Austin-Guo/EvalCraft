they are positioned skewed sideways with respect to the longitudinal axis of the body ( of the robot ) with their distal ends pointing radially away from the main body ( of the robot ) .
locomotive force is produced as the bellow ( 11 ) extends to push against the internal walls of the organ .
this collapsible mechanism is a safe guard against puncturing and perforation of the delicate walls .
the computer program will ensure that the polarity of the input voltage will cause the motor ( 80 ) to turn in the desired direction .
as shown in fig5 there is shown how alternate sets of bellows ( 11 ) are sequenced to extend and retract simultaneously to bring about forward locomotion .
if the friction is arranged to be large enough so that the point of contact does not slide , there will be a resultant force that pushes the robot ( 1 ) forward .
