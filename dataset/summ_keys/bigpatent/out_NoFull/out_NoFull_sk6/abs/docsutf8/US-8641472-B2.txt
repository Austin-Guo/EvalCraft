in a similar manner , a further nine body sections 5 are longitudinally arranged between the central body section 3 and the tail 4 , each body section 5 again being pivotally attached to their adjacent segments .
this representation may be applied by engraving , embossing or printing on the top surface of these sections .
in the presently described embodiment , a set of free spinning wheels 6 are located on the bottom surface of the fourth and fifteenth body sections 5 , the central body section 3 and the tail 4 .
these wheels 6 assist the movement of the snake 1 across a surface , as described in further detail below .
the tail 4 also comprises a plurality of beads which rattle during the movement of the snake 1 across a surface , thus further adding to the authenticity of the snake 1 .
it is preferable for the pcb to comprise a receiver 10 such that the snake 1 can be controlled via a remote control unit 11 .
