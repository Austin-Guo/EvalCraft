the present invention is now described in more detail by reference to the following examples .
the examples are only used for illustrating the present invention without limiting the scope of the present invention .
6 ) were added into a tube reactor having a diameter of 1 inch and a length of 5 centimeter to obtain a catalyst bed .
the resultant mixture was continuously fed into the catalyst bed heated at a temperature of 260 Â° c .
the nicotinic acid was first sampled from reactor and rinsed with water , and then injected into hplc and quantified .
after continuous reacting for 13 days , the catalyst was sampled and analyzed by electronic microscopy .
