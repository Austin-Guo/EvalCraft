the ball also will slide axially a limited amount along the axis of the pin , as well as being able to rotate on the crank pin .
also shown in fig3 are a pair of detent members indicated generally at 38 , which are spring loaded , slidable members 38a that have points that bear against the end surfaces of the support portion 26 of the frame 21 .
the support portions 26 can have small dimples or recesses 38b therein into which the end portions of members 38a will fit .
there may be two of these detent recesses or dimples in the support portions 26 , so that the handle 13 will be detented in at least two angular positions about the pivot axis of the screws 22 .
for example one such position is shown in fig4 and the other position can be at an opposite direction incline , as well as generally perpendicular to the axis of the socket .
the plates 23 and 24 are spaced apart in direction along the axis of the socket used and together form a mounting assembly .
