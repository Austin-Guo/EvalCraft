the invention will now be described , purely by way of non limiting example , with reference to the appended drawings comprising figures numbered from 1 to 11 which show schematically the production sequence of a product according to the invention , as well as a fig1 , which corresponds to a section taken on the line xii xii of fig1 , on a slightly enlarged scale .
although the reference to a substance such as chocolate indicates a preferred solution , it should in no way be interpreted as limiting of the scope of the invention .
this also applies in particular to the use of the term & # 34 ; chocolate & # 34 ; which should not be interpreted herein as being limited exclusively to compositions which can be called chocolate within the meaning of the standards for food products which are in force in some countries .
the term chocolate used herein as indicative of a mouldable substance , should therefore be interpreted as including any product or substance having rheological characteristics similar or substantially comparable to those of chocolate .
these are techniques widely known in the confectionery industry and a detailed description of their characteristics is therefore unnecessary in this context .
