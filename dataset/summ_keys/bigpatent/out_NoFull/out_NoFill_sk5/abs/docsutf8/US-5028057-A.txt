a tool spindle 2 extends out of the end of the housing of a drill hammer 1 , which end is on the side of the workpiece and is only shown in part .
the tool spindle 2 transmits a torque on the one hand and axial strokes , on the other hand , to a tool receptacle 3 which is securely connected with it .
two recesses 7 which are closed in the axial direction at both sides are arranged at the tool shaft 5 so as to be located opposite one another on a diagonal line ; assigned locking bodies 8 of the tool holder 3 are constructed as balls to engage in the recesses 7 .
as can be seen in fig2 the slot or groove like recesses 7 have a circular cylindrical cross sectional shape .
as can be seen in fig2 the rotary driving grooves 9 are situated so as to be offset at different angles relative to the recesses 7 .
