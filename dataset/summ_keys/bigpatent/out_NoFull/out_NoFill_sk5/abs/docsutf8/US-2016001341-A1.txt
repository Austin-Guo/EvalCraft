fig1 to 9 are different illustrations showing the production of an exemplary embodiment of a torsional profile according to the invention by means of the method according to the invention for producing a torsional profile from a tubular hollow profile 1 .
in this exemplary embodiment , the tubular hollow body 1 has a circular cross section , such that the walls of the tubular hollow profile 1 have an initial spacing d 1 .
in the cross sectional illustration as per fig4 , it can now be seen that the tubular hollow profile 1 , before its deformation , has been placed into the deformation die 2 which is in the form of a bottom die , said tubular hollow profile being securely fixed over its longitudinal extent by the readjusting guide elements 14 , which are also simultaneously designed as holders , in the deformation die 2 over its entire longitudinal extent .
fig4 furthermore illustrates a punch 6 by means of which the tubular hollow profile 1 is subsequently deformed by virtue of the punch being pushed downward into the deformation die 2 .
fig7 now shows , in a plan view , a sub region of a device for producing a torsional profile according to the invention , wherein , however , to better illustrate the cross section of the tubular hollow profile , only one half has been illustrated .
