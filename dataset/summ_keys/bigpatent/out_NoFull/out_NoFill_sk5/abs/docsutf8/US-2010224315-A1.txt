in one embodiment , the adhesive coating 312 comprises a black adhesive that can also serve as a masking feature .
it is further noted that when the tape 100 ( or 200 ) is applied to the rack beam 402 , any pits or pockmarks on the beam are securely covered and hidden by the tape , thereby providing a clean , smooth surface upon which any suitable label ( s ) may be affixed .
the presently disclosed tape systems 100 , 200 allow pressure sensitive labels to be easily removed and replaced on rack beams , shelves , or any other suitable object , as many times as necessary .
such labels can be removed without ripping or tearing .
further , new labels can be applied without fear of previous labels or markings affecting the scan of a bar code .
