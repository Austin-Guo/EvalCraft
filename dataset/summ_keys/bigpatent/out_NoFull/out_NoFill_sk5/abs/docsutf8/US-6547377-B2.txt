in accordance with an aspect of the invention , an ink supply is described , wherein measures are taken to prevent the ingress of air into the ink supply from the external environment .
moreover , the ink container holds unsaturated ink , which provides the capability of absorbing some quantity of air within the printing system and therefore preventing or reducing the harmful buildup of air bubbles within the system .
in an exemplary embodiment , the chassis member is a unitary element , fabricated of polyethylene by injection molding .
the collapsible bag is typically fabricated of multiple layers including a metalized or other layer providing very low air diffusion .
this air path is illustrated in fig2 a simplified cross sectional view of the chassis 56 .
