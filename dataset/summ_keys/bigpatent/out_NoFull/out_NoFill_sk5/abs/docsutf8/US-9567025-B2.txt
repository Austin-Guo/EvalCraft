bicycle sharing has been implemented in many towns and cities to support public transportation .
most of these bicycle sharing programs encounter problems related to vandalism , theft , and the high cost of maintenance .
to address these issues , some bicycle sharing programs require the user to leave a deposit or identification to prevent bicycle theft .
attempts to deter theft include the use of bicycles with non removable parts and unique visual appearances , which limit their utility outside of the bicycle sharing program .
recent bicycle sharing programs have attempted to eliminate the need for active management by employing “ smart ” terminals that track the status of rented bicycles .
