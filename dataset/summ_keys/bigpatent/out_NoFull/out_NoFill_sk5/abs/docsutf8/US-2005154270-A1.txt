fig2 depicts the probe vibrator and head that is used in one embodiment of the present invention .
probe head 201 is comprised of one or many small metal plates that each have a surface area of 0 .
each plate is connected to a low noise current to voltage ( i / v ) converter housed within the probe head 201 and a copper shield held at the reference potential surrounds the entire head .
the vibrator unit 209 is designed to move the probe head along a single axis that is perpendicular to the surface of the skin or epithelia under study .
this can be achieved with many types of vibrators based on piezoelectric , magnetostrictive or electromagnetic transducers .
