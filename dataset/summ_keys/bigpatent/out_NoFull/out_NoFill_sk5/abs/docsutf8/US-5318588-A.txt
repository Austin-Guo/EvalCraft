our invention concerns the use of a radially expandable tubular element in the construction of medical devices containing tubular components and / or channels .
in particular , our invention concerns the use of the tubular elements in the construction of device components and channels that function to conduct or convey medical instruments and / or guidewires therethrough .
the use of radially expandable tubular elements in the construction of delivery catheters enables their manufacture with lower composite profiles relative to prior art device delivery catheters of comparable delivery capacity .
the use of radially expandable guidewire channels in the construction of exchangeable guidewire directed diagnostic / therapeutic devices enables their manufacture with lower shaft profiles than heretofore possible .
the luminal profile of shaft section 7 is sufficient to accommodate the profile of the largest device intended for delivery therethrough .
