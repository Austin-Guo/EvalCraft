the relative positions of the base 402 and connector 404 can be fixed by a set screw 438 which is directed through an upper portion 440 of the base 402 and against the outer surface 422 of the connector 404 above the center point 442 so that the advancing set screw 438 cams the connector 404 progressively into the receptacle 418 .
the invention contemplates several different ways of setting up the instrument support structure 400 .
the subassembly consisting of the base 402 and connector 404 is then placed against the tissue 412 so that the incision 414 coincides with the opening defined by the base bore 434 .
according to the invention , it is preferred that the bottom edge 462 of the connector 404 be adjacent to the flat base surface 408 with the base 402 and connector 404 in operative relationship .
if the base 402 were shortened in a vertical direction , as indicated by the phantom lines 464 , the connector 404 would project slightly below the base surface 408 and would thus be urged directly against the tissue 412 as the support structure 400 is assembled to the tissue 412 .
