the emergency apparatus , constructed according to the present invention and generally designated 10 , is particularly adapted for use with an abandoned travel trailer t having a pre - existing electrical wiring harness or system , generally designated 13 , and a draft tongue 11 . the pre - existing wiring system 13 includes headlights and / or tail lights 12 and 12 a , coupled to ground potential via an electrical circuit line 16 and a circuit line 18 which independently connects turn signals 14 and 14 a , also referred to as lt and rt , to ground potential and includes a series connected flasher circuit or capacitor , generally designated c , for intermittently charging and discharging electrical energy to the turn signals 14 and 14 a , as usual . it should be understood that any number of additional or different lighting circuits may be coupled to additional or other lights ( not shown ) such as overhead lamps 86 , can be utilized but are not illustrated herein . an electrical pigtail connector or coupler , generally designated 19 , is coupled to the trailer wiring , generally designated 13 , and comprises a conventional seven way trailer socket which is well known in the art . the connector 19 includes an insulated socket housing h provided with a plurality of female sockets s therein mounting a plurality of so - called female socket terminals , generally designated 17 , and more particularly including seven individual terminals 20 , 20 a , 21 , 22 , 22 a , 25 and 25 a , which are coupled to various circuit elements on the trailer t , as will be more particularly described hereinafter . the trailer t includes an emergency braking system which is schematically illustrated as a normally de - energized electrical solenoid 31 coupled , via circuit line 23 a electrically connected to ground potential and to a circuit line 23 that is also electrically connected to ground potential and includes a trailer mounted battery 28 and a normally open “ dead man switch ” 29 which is automatically closed when the trailer t is inadvertently unhitched from a draft vehicle v to actuate the brake solenoid 31 . the circuit line 23 a , which includes the battery 28 and the brake solenoid 31 , is connected to the female socket terminal 25 via a circuit line 26 . if desired , the central terminal 21 may be coupled in circuit with power supply and trailer backup lights ( not shown ). when the trailer is being towed by a draft vehicle v , the socket coupler 19 is coupled to a complementally formed male coupler or pigtail 19 a on the tow vehicle v as illustrated in chain lines in fig1 . the pigtail 19 a includes a plurality of blade terminals , generally designated 19 b , which when the connector 19 is disposed in the position illustrated in chain lines in fig1 , are detachably received by the female socket terminals 17 for connecting the automobile battery 28 a in circuit with the terminals 20 and 22 and the lights 12 and 14 . when the vehicle v and trailer t are unhitched as illustrated in fig1 a , the trailer coupler pigtail 19 is disconnected from the male tow vehicle pigtail 19 a as illustrated in solid lines in fig1 . in order to energize the lights 12 and 14 when the trailer coupler 19 is disconnected from the tow vehicle connector 19 a , an additional trailer mounted male coupler plug or connector 60 , which is circular in cross section and is slidably received by a storage holder , generally designated 40 ( fig2 a ). the storage holder 40 includes a base 42 which is mounted on the upper side of the trailer tongue 11 and includes an integral , expansible and contractible sleeve 44 comprising a pair of upstanding , curvilinear legs 46 and 48 which are cantileverly integrally supported on the base 42 and include terminal ends 50 and 52 , respectively , which are spaced apart by a gap 54 . the device 40 may suitably comprise electrically nonconductive material such as plastic which will yield to axially receive the mating couplers 60 and 19 , with each having an outside diameter that is equal to or slightly greater than the inside diameter of the sleeve 44 . the male connector 60 includes a plurality of electrical blades or prongs , generally designated 61 , which are generally complementally formed to the female receptacles 17 for slidably receiving therein ( fig2 a and 4 ). the receptacles 17 are schematically illustrated in fig3 as being generally rectangular and in fig4 as including u - shaped spring metal blades 70 each having a base leg 71 and a folded over terminal leg 72 which is yieldably urged from the inoperative position , illustrated in chain lines in fig4 , to the operative electrical energizing position , illustrated in solid lines in fig4 , when the socket connector 19 is axially moved into the storage holder 40 and is electrically connected to the mating male connector 60 disposed in the storage device 40 . the male connector 60 may be referred to as a “ dummy plug ” for stowing the pigtail connector a as the blades 61 are not normally electrically connected to the trailer circuitry 13 unless a short circuiting switch 75 is intentionally closed . the male coupling or connector 60 for energizing the lights 12 and 14 of the abandoned vehicle , includes blades , generally designated 61 and more particularly individually designated 62 , 63 , 64 , 62 a , 63 a and 64 a which are slidably received in female receptacles 25 , 20 , 22 , 25 a , 20 a and 22 a , respectively , as schematically illustrated in fig3 and 4 . the apparatus 10 also includes a circuit completion system , generally designated 80 ( fig1 and 3 ), which includes a line 82 electrically coupled to the blades 62 and 64 . the line 82 includes the normally opened switch 75 and a fuse 77 . the circuit line 82 , via the plug blades 62 , 63 , and 64 and the mating female socket terminals 25 , 20 and 22 , thus electrically connects the trailer battery 28 to the lights 12 and 14 . the normally open short circuit switch 75 can be manually operated to complete an electrical circuit from the battery 28 and independent circuit line 26 to the trailer lights 12 and 14 via independent circuit lines 16 and 18 so that the lights 12 and 14 can be selectively energized or de - energized as necessary and desirable . as illustrated in fig3 , the female sockets 25 a , 20 a and 22 a are illustrated as being electrically connected to clearance lamp 86 , head or tail lamps 12 a and right turn signal lamp 14 a via circuit lines 85 , 16 a and 18 a , respectively , and to female sockets 25 , 20 and 22 via circuit lines 83 a and 83 b , 83 a , and 84 , respectively . when the trailer t is coupled to the draft vehicle v , the trailer pigtail or female socket coupler or connector 19 is coupled to the tow vehicle male coupler or pigtail 19 a , as illustrated in chain lines in fig1 . when the tow vehicle v is disconnected from the trailer t , the trailer pigtail connector or female socket 19 is decoupled the tow vehicle v and moved from the vehicle coupling position , illustrated in chain lines in fig1 , to the inoperative position illustrated in solid lines in fig1 axially aligned with the opening o in the storage unit 40 . the trailer connector 19 is then moved axially inwardly into the opening or the storage unit 40 until it is received by the male connector 60 with male blades 61 radially outwardly urging the female socket terminal legs 72 to the position illustrated in fig4 . when it is desired to electrically operate the lamps 12 and 14 of the abandoned trailer t , the normally open hand operated switch 75 is closed to short circuit male terminal blades 62 , 63 and 64 so that electrical power will flow from the trailer battery 28 via circuit line 26 to the female socket 25 , thence to the male blade 62 , circuit lines 82 and 83 to sockets 20 , 22 , 25 a , 20 a and 22 a , so that all of the lamps 12 , 12 a , 14 , 14 a and 86 are lighted . it should be further understood that although the trailer pigtail 19 is illustrated as being a female socket and the vehicle connector 19 a and the stowing plug 60 are illustrated as being male , it should be understood they could be reversed such that the trailer mounted pigtail connector 19 was a male connector and the vehicle connector 19 a and the stowing plug 19 are female sockets . it is to be understood that the drawings and descriptive matter are in all cases to be interpreted as merely illustrative of the principles of the invention , rather than as limiting the same in any way , since it is contemplated that various changes may be made in various elements to achieve like results without departing from the spirit of the invention or the scope of the appended claims .
