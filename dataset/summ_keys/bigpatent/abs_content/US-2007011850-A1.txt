referring now more specifically the drawings and to fig1 in particular , a strap securing device 20 in accordance with the present invention is shown installed on a strap 22 . as will become apparent from the following description in accordance with the drawings , strap securing device 20 can be used for securing portions of straps of various sizes in various installations . strap 22 is an elongate web of material , such as , for example , natural or synthetic cloth , flexible leather and the like commonly used on devices of various types , including equipment , clothing , backpacks , bags and other devices . fig1 illustrates strap 22 as being an end portion of a strap having a terminal end 24 . accordingly , strap securing device 20 is shown installed on the strap end for securing multiple layers of the strap folded thereon . however , it should be understood from the description to follow that strap securing device 20 can be installed on another portion of the strap , such as a portion being used , and not only on an unused terminal portion of the strap . further , in some applications and uses , a strap securing device of the present invention can be secured to or on an article in an appropriate position to receive and hold portions of a strap used on or with the article . strap securing device 20 includes a holder 30 and a retainer 32 connected to and operable with holder 30 for securing a free end portion of strap 22 relative to holder 30 . in the exemplary embodiment of the present invention , as illustrated in fig2 , holder 30 is plastic of suitable strength , rigidity and other performance characteristics for the environment and installation on which device 20 is used . however , holder 30 can be of other materials , such as metal . retainer 32 is a looped elastic or elastic - type stretchable cord 34 having a terminator 36 securing ends ( not shown ) of cord 34 . terminator 36 can be plastic or other material similar to holder 30 , or can be of other suitable material , such as metal . holder 30 extends from one side or edge of strap 22 to an opposite side or edge of strap 22 . holder 30 includes a base 40 supported on strap 22 , as will be described more fully hereinafter . at opposite ends of base 40 , a first end portion 42 and a second end portion 44 extend along and outwardly of opposite side edges of strap 22 . base 40 defines a first slot 46 and a second slot 48 spaced from each other in base 40 . slots and 46 and 48 are of sufficient length to receive the width of strap 22 so that strap 22 can be threaded through slots 46 and 48 , thereby securing device 20 on strap 22 . in the exemplary embodiment , entrance openings 50 , 52 extend between opposite side outer edges of base 40 and slots 46 , 48 , respectively . strap 22 can be inserted through entrance openings 50 , 52 into slots 46 , 48 at intermediate points along the length of strap 22 , and it is not necessary to attach device 20 by threading strap 22 via end 24 through slots 46 , 48 . accordingly , strap securing device 20 can be attached to strap 22 after terminal end 24 is folded over and sewn or otherwise terminated . even if terminal end 24 is thicker than the width of slots 46 , 48 , or is attached to an end buckle or other component , device 20 can be attached to strap 22 . moreover , entrance openings 50 , 52 allow removal and attachment of device 20 along intermediate portions of a strap secured on its opposite ends . thus , device 20 can be installed in the active or useful portion of the strap and have the unused portion secured thereby . entrance openings 50 , 52 also enable convenient removal of a broken device 20 and replacement with a new device 20 if necessary . the arrangement of slots 46 , 48 is such as to provide a sufficiently tortuous path that base 40 remains securely positioned along strap 22 after strap 22 has been placed in slots 46 , 48 and pulled taut . in the exemplary embodiment seen most clearly in fig2 , slots 46 , 48 are angularly disposed with respect to each other , being spaced farther from one another near first end 42 and closer to one another near second end 44 . an eyelet 54 is provided in base 40 near first and 42 . elastic cord 34 is secured to holder 30 by knotting , hitching or the like with a portion inserted through eyelet 54 . as illustrated in the exemplary embodiment of the drawings , elastic cord 34 is passed through eyelet 54 and looped through itself . first end 42 further includes abutments 56 , 58 extending away from base 40 and spaced from one another to allow elastic cord 34 to pass there between . those skilled in the art should understand that other configurations also can be used . abutments 56 , 58 provide a side support for the folded and stacked lengths of strap 22 secured by device 20 . as seen most clearly in fig3 , second end portion 44 angles upwardly from base 40 to provide clearance for terminator 36 positioned there beneath when device 20 is in use . second end portion 44 forms a latch for engaging elastic cord 34 and specifically the distal end of elastic cord 34 , having terminator 36 thereon . in the exemplary embodiment , second end portion 44 is an angular , plate - like extension from base 40 and includes spaced , angularly inwardly extending elongated holes 60 , 62 for receiving opposed segments of looped elastic cord 34 . holes 60 , 62 open through the outer edge of second portion 44 so that cord 34 can be placed therein . in the exemplary configuration for holes 60 , 62 outer edges 64 , 66 thereof are substantially smooth , and inner edges 68 , 70 thereof are curved sharply to hold elastic cord 34 therein . thus , from the position illustrated in fig1 , elastic cord 34 can not be dislodged easily from holes 60 , 62 by pulling straight outwardly on terminator 36 . instead , to dislodge cord 34 , terminator 36 is rocked sideways , first in one direction and then in the opposite direction substantially parallel to strap 22 , to thereby dislodge first one side of elastic cord 34 from one of the holes 60 , 62 and then to dislodge the other side of elastic cord 34 from the other of holes 60 , 62 . an end surface 72 of second end portion 44 is curved , having an apex between holes 60 and 62 , and is shaped and angled to promote separation of the opposed segments of looped elastic cord 34 and to direct the separated opposed segments into holes 60 , 62 . a portion of base 40 between slots 46 and 48 can be provided with surface insignia or other surface configurations 74 providing increased friction against movement of strap 22 along base 40 . in the use of strap securing device 20 , holder 30 is attached at a desired location along strap 22 by inserting portions of strap 22 through entrance openings 50 , 52 and into slots 46 , 48 . a loose portion of strap 22 is fan folded over holder 30 , between abutments 54 , 56 and one side and the upwardly angled second end portion 44 on the opposite side . after strap 22 is appropriately stacked and positioned , elastic cord 34 is pulled from first end 42 toward second end 44 , over the stacked portion of strap 22 on base 40 . terminator 36 is pulled past end surface 72 of second end 44 , and elastic cord 34 is hooked to second end portion 44 in holes 60 , 62 . end surface 72 separates the opposed segments of elastic cord 34 as cord 34 is pulled there against . end surface 72 directs the opposed segments into holes 60 , 62 . the elasticity of cord 34 holds cord 34 securely in holes 60 , 62 . the inwardly directed force from cord 34 against the curved configuration of inner edges 68 , 70 of holes 60 , 62 holds cord 34 securely in holes 60 , 62 . elastic cord 34 holds the stacked portions of strap 22 securely against base 40 , between abutments 56 , 58 along one side and second end 44 on the opposite side . to free the secured portion of strap 22 , terminator 36 is pulled sideways in first one direction and then the opposite direction substantially parallel to cord 22 , to dislodge elastic cord 34 from holes 60 , 62 . smooth outer edges 64 , 66 allow elastic cord 34 to slide easily out of holes 60 , 62 when pulled sideways as described . however , the attachment of cord 34 to second end 44 is secure in that complete detachment requires pulling first in one direction and then in the other , opposite direction to free the opposite sides of cord 34 from holes 60 , 62 . if terminator 36 is inadvertently snagged or pulled in only one direction , cord 34 is not completely dislodged . strap securing device 20 is easy to install initially and easy to use both when securing portions of strap 22 and when freeing the secured portions if strap 22 is to be adjusted . the device is secure yet is not attached permanently to the strap and can be removed if desired . as can be seen most clearly in fig1 , with the understanding from the side view of fig3 , terminator 36 fits snuggly and smoothly beneath second end portion 44 even when device 20 is fitted against a relatively firm and flat surface . however , in some applications and uses of the present invention it may not be necessary to provide side support for the folded and stacked end of strap 22 , or to provide the nested position for terminator 36 . further , the device may be easily threaded by inserting an end through the device . fig4 -
