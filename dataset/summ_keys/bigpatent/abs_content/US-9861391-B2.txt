this disclosure provides a system for securing a bone to a rod , the system comprising a ligature , a body , and two fasteners . the ligature has two free ends and an intermediate portion therebetween , the intermediate portion being configured to engage a bone . a portion of a rod can be fastened to the body using one of the fasteners . the ligature can be fastened to the body using another one of the fasteners . the two fasteners are distinct from one another and are adapted to fasten two free end portions of the ligature to the body independently from fastening the portion of the rod to the body .
in the following detailed description , it is referred to the accompanying drawings showing several examples of bone fixing systems according to the present disclosure . it is intended that these examples be considered as illustrative but not limiting , the scope of the invention being given by the accompanying claims . an example of bone fixing system is shown on fig1 . to 3 . the bone fixing system 10 is for fixing a rod 5 ( a portion of which is shown in fig1 , 3 and 15 ) to a bone ( see fig1 ), the bone may be , for instance , a lamina of a vertebra or a transverse process tp of a vertebra v , as shown in fig1 . a conformable elongate member 7 , such as a ligature , having a first free end portion 7 a , a second free end portion 7 b , and an intermediate portion 7 c therebetween , said intermediate portion 7 c being adapted to surround the bone ( e . g . the transverse process tp ); first fastening device or means for fastening a portion of the rod 5 to the main body 12 ; and second fastening device or means for fastening the free end portions 7 a , 7 b of the elongate member 7 to the main body 12 , said second fastening means being distinct from the first fastening means . the elongate member 7 may be any suitable material that is conformable such as a band , wire , or cord made of metal , a polymeric material , or a combination of the two . the second fastening means comprise a compression member 14 which is movable relative to the main body 12 , the compression member 14 and the main body 12 both defining clamping surfaces 14 c , 12 c , between which the free end portions 7 a , 7 b of the elongate member 7 may be inserted , said free end portions 7 a , 7 b being clamped between said clamping surfaces 12 c , 14 c by moving the compression member 14 relative to the main body 12 . the main body 12 is hollow , extends along a first axis z from its lower end to its upper end , and comprises : a main part 12 a with upwardly extending side walls 13 defining between them a first internal passage 20 extending along said first axis z and opening onto the outside of the main body 12 at its upper end ; and a bottom part 12 b located under the main part 12 a and provided with a second internal passage 22 extending through the entire thickness of the bottom part 12 b and communicating with the first internal passage 20 . the main body 12 further comprises third and fourth internal passages 43 , 44 through which the first and second free end portions 7 a , 7 b of the elongate member 7 may be inserted respectively . each internal passage 43 ( 44 ) extends through the main body 12 , has two ends 4 43 b ( 44 a , 44 b ) and opens , at one end 43 a ( 44 a ), in front of the compression member 14 and , at the other end 43 b ( 44 b ), onto an outer face of the main body and , more precisely , onto a side face of the main body 12 . the third and fourth internal passages 43 , 44 form guiding means for the free end portions 7 a , 7 b of the elongate member 7 . in the example the third and fourth internal passages 43 , 44 extend , respectively , along third and fourth axis a , a ′, each of the third and fourth axis forming with respect to said first axis z an acute angle c which is preferably comprised between 0 and 70 . degree . thus , it is easier for the physician to pull on the ends 7 a , 7 b of the elongate member 7 for tensioning it . on the other hand , the clamping surfaces 14 c , 12 c of the compression member 14 and of the main body 12 define between them fifth and sixth passages 53 , 54 extending , respectively , along fifth and sixth axis b , b ′, each of the fifth and sixth axis forming with respect to said first axis z an obtuse angle d . the compression member 14 is provided with a threaded hole 24 . said locking mechanism comprises a first screw 26 having a head 26 a and a shaft 26 b with an external thread . the screw shaft 26 b passes through the second internal passage 22 and the screw head 26 a has a profile 28 that allows the first screw 26 to be driven . in the example , the screw head 26 a is a socket head and , more particularly , a hex socket head which can be driven , for instance , by an allen key . when the first screw 26 is driven , the external thread of the shaft 26 b engages with the threaded hole 24 of the compression member 14 and the screw head 26 a bears on the upper face 12 d of the bottom part 12 b . thus , the clamping surfaces 14 c , 12 c are brought closer together and the end portions 7 a , 7 b are locked in position by clamping between the clamping surfaces 14 c , 12 c . turning now to the first fastening means for fastening a portion of the rod 5 to the main body 12 , openings 30 are provided in the side wails 13 ( see fig2 ), so that a portion of the rod 5 may be loaded into the main body 12 via said openings 30 , and a closure member 32 engages with the main body 12 so as to secure said portion of rod 5 to the main body . in the example , the main body 12 is provided with a first thread 13 b for engagement with a second thread 32 a provided on the closure member 32 , so that said portion of rod 5 may be clamped between the main body 12 and the closure member by threadably moving the closure member 32 relative to the main body 12 . more precisely , in the example , the rod portion is clamped between the edges 13 a of the side walls 13 delimiting the bottom of the openings 30 , and the lower face of the closure member 32 . in the example , the closure member 32 has an external thread 32 a engaging with an internal thread 13 b provided on the inner face of the side walls 13 . the closure member 32 further comprises a socket head 32 b for driving it in rotation . another example of bone fixing system is shown on fig4 . the bone fixing system 110 of fig4 differs from that of fig3 by the locking mechanism . in fig3 , the second internal passage 22 of the bottom part 12 b is provided with an internal thread 123 , and the compression member 114 has a protruding part 114 a forming said locking mechanism . said protruding part 114 a extends upwardly , has on its upper end a profile 128 that allows the compression member 114 to be driven in rotation , and is provided with an external thread 114 b engaging with said internal thread 123 . it should be noted that , e examples of fig1 - 4 , the bottom part 12 b of the main body 12 is integral with the main part 12 a of the main body 12 . this is not the case in the examples of fig5 - 7 . fig5 and 6 show another example of bone fixing system 210 differing from that of fig1 - 3 in that it comprises a main body 112 with a bottom part 212 b and a main part 212 a which are not integral with each other . in this example , the bottom part 212 b and the main part 212 a of the main body 212 are interconnected by a ball - and - socket connection . the main part 212 a comprises a bottom wall 250 , the bottom wall 250 being provided with a through hole 251 delimited by an upper edge 251 a . the ball - and - socket type connection comprises a second screw 252 having a head 252 a and a shaft 252 b . the screw shaft 252 b passes through said through hole 251 and through the second internal passage 222 . the screw head 252 a has a convex lower face 252 c bearing on said upper edge 251 a , and a profile that allows the second screw 252 to be driven . for instance , the screw head 252 a may be a hex - head or a socket - head . the screw head 252 a further has a concave upper face 252 d . when the rod 5 is locked in position by means of the first fastening means , the rod 5 leans against the concave upper face 252 d of the second screw 252 . more precisely , when the closure member 32 is screwed down , the closure member 32 pushes down on the rod 5 which in turn pushes down on the screw 252 until the convex lower face 252 c of the screw head 252 a leans against the upper edge 251 a of the through hole 251 . since the contact zones between the screw head 252 a and the upper edge 251 a and between the screw head 252 a and the rod 5 , are limited , the screw head 252 a is able to move with respect to the he main part 212 a of the main body 212 . the above structure is one example of a ball - and - socket type connection but other examples could be used . a ball - and - socket type connection allows a limited amount of relative movement between the bottom part 212 b and the main part 212 a of the main body 212 and , thus , between the bone and the rod 5 , thereby providing or improving the desired dynamic stabilizing effect . the bottom part 212 b is substantially the same as the bottom part 12 b of fig3 except for the screw head 226 a which has an outer driving profile 228 ( instead of the inner driving profile 28 ), and apart from the fact that the screw 226 is provided with an internal threaded hole 227 . the screw shaft 252 b , which has an external thread , passes through the second internal passage 222 and engages with the threaded hole 227 , so as to connect together the bottom part 212 b and the main part 212 a of the main body 212 . another example of bone fixing system 310 with a ball - and - socket type connection is shown on fig7 . in this example , the main part 312 a of the main body 312 and the second screw 352 are the same as those ( 212 a , 252 ) of fig6 , and the bottom part 312 b of the main body 312 is substantially the same as the bottom part 12 b of fig4 apart from the fact that the protruding part 314 a of the compression member 314 has an outer driving profile 328 instead of the inner driving profile 128 , and that the compression member 314 is provided with an internal threaded hole 327 . the screw shaft 352 b , which has an external thread , passes through the second internal passage 322 and engages with the threaded hole 327 , so as to connect together the bottom part 312 b and the main part 312 a of the main body 312 . in both examples of fig6 and 7 , the screw shaft 252 b , 352 b passes through the through hole 251 , 351 of the bottom wail 250 , 350 of the main part 212 a , 312 a and through the second internal passage 222 , 322 and engages with the compression member 214 , 314 . on fig7 , it engages directly with the compression member 314 , whereas on fig6 , it engages indirectly with the compression member 214 , via the screw 226 . other examples of bone fixing systems 410 , 510 , 610 , 710 , for fixing a bone to a rod 5 , are shown on fig8 to 13 . each of them comprises : a conformable elongate member 7 having a first free end portion 7 a , a second free end portion 7 b , and an intermediate portion 7 c therebetween , said intermediate portion 7 c being adapted to surround said bone ; first fastening device or means for fastening a portion of the rod 5 to the main body 412 , 512 , 612 , 712 ; and second fastening device or means for fastening the free end portions 7 b of the elongate member 7 to the main body 412 , 512 , 612 , 712 , said second fastening device or means being distinct from the first fastening device or means . in the systems of fig8 - 12 , the first fastening device or means for fastening a portion of the rod 5 to the main body 412 , 512 , 612 , are the same as those of fig1 - 4 and , therefore , do not need to be described again . in all the examples of fig8 - 13 , the second fastening means comprise a compression member which is movable relative to the main body 412 , 512 , 612 , the compression member and the main body both defining clamping surfaces between which the free end portions 7 a , 7 b of the elongate member 7 may be inserted , said free end portions being clamped between said clamping surfaces by moving the compression member relative to the main body . in the example of fig8 , the compression member 414 is provided with a thread 414 d for rotative engagement with another thread 412 a provided on the main body 412 , so that the free end portions 7 a , 7 b of the elongate member 7 may be clamped between a compression part 412 e of the main body 412 and the compression member 414 by threadably moving the compression member 414 relative to the main body 412 , in this example , the compression member 414 is a nut provided with an internal thread 414 d , and the main body 412 is provided with an external thread 412 a . when the compression member 414 is screwed or unscrewed , it moves closer or farther away from the compression part 412 e . a compression part 41 which is a flange protruding on the lateral faces of the main body 412 , and two internal passages 453 , 454 through which the first and second free end portions 7 a , 7 b of the elongate member may be inserted respectively , each of the third and fourth internal passages 453 , 454 extending through the main body , having two ends and opening , at one end , in front of the compression member 414 and , at the other end , onto an outer face of the main body 412 and , more precisely , onto the end face of the main body 412 which is opposite to the other end face receiving the rod 5 . when the compression member 414 is threadably engaged with the main body 412 , it moves closer or farther away from the compression part 412 e . in the example of fig9 , the compression member 514 is also a nut provided with an internal thread 514 d ( see fig1 ), and the main body 512 is also provided with an external thread 512 a , but in this case , the compression member 514 is not in direct contact with the elongate member 7 . indeed , the compression member 514 cooperates with two profiled rotating pieces 515 which are rotatably mounted ( around the axis r ) in recesses 512 i provided on the lateral faces of the main body 512 . when the compression member 514 moves along the main body 512 , it pushes the rotating pieces 515 in the recesses 512 i , and each free end portion 7 a , 7 b of the elongate member is clamped between a rotating piece 515 and the bottom wall of the recess 512 i . in the example of fig1 , the compression member 614 is a circlip and the main body has a peripheral groove 612 i for receiving the free end portions 7 a , 7 b of the elongate member and the compression member 614 . the free end portions 7 a , 7 b are inserted and clamped between the bottom of the groove 612 i and the compression member 614 . the compression member 614 could also be a fastening collar . the peripheral groove 612 i may extend along the entire circumference of the main body 612 , or along a part of it . in the example of fig1 , the second fastening device or means comprise a screw 764 and a compression member 714 which is provided with a through hole 760 . the main body 712 of the bone fixing system 710 is provided with a threaded hole 762 aligned with said through hole 760 . the shaft 764 b of the screw 764 passes through said through hole 760 and is threadably engaged with the threaded hole 762 . the head 764 a of the screw 764 is intended to lean against the upper surface of the compression member 714 . the compression member 714 and the main body 712 both define clamping surfaces between which the free end portions 7 a , 7 b of the elongate member may be inserted and clamped , said free end portions being clamped by screwing the screw 764 into the main body 712 . in the example of hg . 13 , the first fastening device or means comprise a seat part 766 for receiving a portion of the rod 5 , the seat part 766 facing the intermediate portion 7 c of the elongate member 7 , said portion of rod 5 being clamped between the seat part 766 and the intermediate portion 7 c of the elongate member by tightening the elongate member 7 ( i . e . by pulling on the free end portions 7 a , 7 b of the elongate member 7 ). preferably , the seat part 766 is a clip for holding the rod 5 . for instance , the seat part 766 is delimited by two open arms 763 with certain elasticity , said arms 763 partially surrounding the rod 5 . turning now to fig1 , the bone fixing system 10 of fig1 - 3 is shown in a tightened position around a vertebra v . more precisely , the intermediate portion 7 c of the elongate member 7 surrounds the transverse process tp of the vertebra . by pulling on the ends of the elongate member 7 , the compression member 14 of the system 10 comes into contact with the transverse process tp . the compression member 14 may be made in a soft material , order to avoid damaging the vertebra v and / or to allow a limited amount of relative movement between the vertebra v and the system 10 , and thus between the vertebra v and the rod 5 , thereby providing a dynamic stabilization effect , more particularly , compared to the material which makes up the main body 12 and which is preferably rigid , the material the compression member 14 is softer . in order to improve the cushioning effect and / or the dynamic stabilization effect , the compression member 14 ′ may be provided with at least one peripheral groove 19 ′ on its side faces . such a peripheral groove 19 ′ makes the deformation of the compression member 14 ′ easier and allows the member 14 ′ to bend laterally and to compress axially . thus a limited amount of relative movement ( including pivoting movement ) between the vertebra . v and the system 10 is allowed , as illustrated by the double arrow p on fig1 .
