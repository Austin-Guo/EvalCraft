a resilient , shock absorption assembly that mounts between available sail rigging lines and a boat hull . in one assembly , a piston is resiliently biased relative to a housing and contained spring to permit reciprocating movement . couplers at distal ends of the piston and housing attach to suitable rigging lines and / or the boat . in other assemblies , resilient elastomer cores bias movement of a piston or cable . in another assembly fitted within a main sail boom , a cable biases the boom rigging lines . in still another construction , an “ a - shape ”, mast replacement framework is secured to pivot from a boat &# 39 ; s deck . resiliently biased cables act as a mast and support a sail boom . one or more separate resilient assemblies can be coupled to the sail . the cable mast and rigging lines are thus made resilient to counterbalance the boat against heeling with the presence of rough water and gusty winds .
referring to fig1 a view is shown in partial section to a sailboat 2 ( shown in dashed line ). mounted about the sailboat 2 and shown in solid line are several resilient , shock absorber assemblies 4 , 6 and 8 . the assemblies 4 , 6 and 8 are generally similar in that each provides a controlled , resilient resistance to reciprocating movement of a piston that responds to forces in excess of a threshold force and over a flexion range of a contained resilient member and / or material . the assembly 4 includes a spring that biases movement of the piston and is shown in greater detail in the exploded assembly drawing of fig2 . the assemblies 6 include a compressible elastomer , although the assemblies 6 can be replaced with the assembly 4 . either of the assemblies 4 or 6 may also be constructed with a closed hydraulic or pneumatic chamber that provides a resilient reciprocating motion to a contained piston . the boom - mounted assembly 8 , in turn , is shown in greater detail at fig3 . the absorber assemblies 4 , 6 and 8 are secured to various of the rigging lines 10 and 12 that control the main sail 13 and jib or genoa sail 14 . as depicted , the main sail 13 is controlled with a single assembly 4 . a coupler 16 secures a housing end of the absorber assembly 4 to the end of the main boom 18 and a resiliently biased piston 20 is secured at another coupler 22 or clevis 56 or coupler 22 to the lines 10 . the main sail lines 10 are anchored to the aft end of the sailboat 2 . depending upon the size of the main sail 13 , the lines 10 can be controlled with one or more pulleys 24 in a block and tackle arrangement to obtain a desired mechanical advantage . the length of the lines 10 are varied to control the orientation of the main boom 18 and main sail 13 relative to the main mast 26 . the jib or genoa sail 14 is depicted as being controlled with two resilient , shock absorption assemblies 6 , which again can be replaced with the assembly 4 . the two assemblies 6 used to control the jib / genoa sail 14 can be arranged in alternative mountings . the two mountings are shown in fig1 with respect to the different mounting positions of the assemblies 6 , it being appreciated that either of these mounting positions can be replicated on the other side of the sail . in the one instance , as shown with respect to the background assembly 6 , both assemblies 6 can be mounted in close association to the jib / genoa 14 with the trailing lines 12 being secured to the port and starboard gunwales in conventional fashion . in the other instance , as shown with respect to the foreground assembly 6 , both assemblies 6 can be mounted closer to and / or be directly anchored to the port and starboard gunwales . difficulties can arise , however , in routing the rigging lines 12 between the assemblies 6 and the sail 14 , which makes this mounting less desirable . like the main sail 13 , the jib / genoa sail 14 can also be controlled with a single assembly 6 . that is , the assembly 6 can be directly attached to the jib / genoa sail 14 and the rigging lines 12 can be secured to the opposite end of the assembly 6 and be routed to the port and starboard gunwales . the main sail 13 can similarly be controlled with multiple assemblies 6 or 4 in the fashion of the jib / genoa sail 14 . alternatively , the assembly 8 , as discussed below with respect to fig3 can be mounted within the main sail boom 18 . in this rigging arrangement , the boom 18 supports a housing 17 that contains a resiliently mounted cable member 19 that is coupled to the control lines 10 via a pulley 21 . in certain circumstances , the boom 18 can be used in lieu of the housing 17 and with only an end stop 82 secured to the in the boom to limit motion of the associated resilient member . it is also possible to sew either of the assemblies 4 or 6 into a pocket or hem of a sail , such as shown at the jib / genoa sail 14 of fig1 . in each of the foregoing mountings of the assemblies 4 and 6 , appropriate couplers secure the assemblies 4 and 6 to the rigging lines 10 and 12 , sails 13 or 14 , boom 18 , and / or to the gunwales . the attachments allow resiliently mounted pistons within the assemblies to extend and retract with swells , troughs and errant gusts of wind to counterbalance the billowing of the sails 13 and 14 and / or heeling of the boat 2 . with attention to fig2 a detailed view is shown to the assembly 4 . the piston 20 is mounted within a tubular housing 32 and is adapted for reciprocating movement relative to a spring 34 . the force exerted by the spring 34 and defined by the spring force constant and range of movement ( i . e . compression and expansion ) of the spring 34 can be designed as desired to provide a preferred degree of resilience . presently , it is preferred that the main sail assembly 4 or 8 exhibit an offsetting force in excess of an initial force in the range of 75 to 95 pounds and a travel range of 6 to 10 - inches . the jib / genoa sail assembly 6 desirably exhibits an offsetting force in excess of an initial force in the range of 65 to 85 pounds and a similar travel range of 6 to 10 - inches . the piston 20 is comprised of an eyebolt 36 having threads 38 at one end and an aperture 40 or other suitable coupler connection 22 at the opposite end . the shaft of the eyebolt 36 is supported in concentric relation along the longitudinal center axis of the spring 34 . the threaded end 38 mounts through an end cap 42 , elastomer bushing 44 , washer 46 , the spring 34 , a second washer 46 and attaches to a nut or threaded fastener 48 . as desired , another bushing 44 ( shown in dashed line ) can be mounted ahead of the nut 46 . upon tightening the nut 48 a degree of pre - loading is established in the spring 34 and bushing ( s ) 44 . subsequent , forces exerted by a rigging line attached the coupler 22 , induces the piston 20 to compress the spring 34 and bushing ( s ) 44 . the degree of preloading or initial compression of the spring 34 might be varied , once the assembly 4 is fitted to a boat 2 , via a slot 49 that allows the nut 48 to be captured with a pin inserted into a hole 51 in the side of the nut 48 . rotation of the eyebolt 36 then determines the preloading . the opposite end of the housing 32 is fitted with an end cap 50 that is fitted with a second eyebolt 52 and nut 48 . a bushing 44 is also positioned in the housing 32 between the nuts 48 to cushion sound that might otherwise emanate from the assembly 4 as the nuts 48 contact each other . a bushing 44 ( shown in dashed line ) might also be secured to the eyebolt 52 to provide additional resilience to the assembly 4 . also shown in fig2 are an alternative end cap 54 , clevis coupler 56 and fastener 58 that can be secured to the end of the housing 32 . it is to be appreciated that a variety of couplers can be secured to the housing 32 and / or piston 20 to facilitate attachment of the assembly 4 the rigging lines of a sailboat 2 . the housing 32 can be constructed of metal or plastic . the end caps 42 and 50 are typically constructed of a similar material and are secured to the housing 32 with threads , welding , adhesive or other suitable fasteners compatible with the housing material and spring force requirements . the piston 20 is thus free to extend and retract relative to the housing 32 . the reciprocating movement is countered via the compression of the spring 34 and / or bushings 44 or any other suitable resiliently compressible material , media or member mounted in the housing 32 to resist movement of the piston 20 relative to the end cap 42 . for the assembly 4 , the resilience is determined by the collective resilience of the spring 34 and bushings 44 . appreciating the spring 34 can be replaced with a variety of resilient members or subassemblies , the assembly 6 includes an elastomer core 60 ( shown in partial cutaway at fig1 ) that resists movement of the piston 36 . the core 60 can be constructed of a variety of materials including rubber , nylon and plastics that might also be impregnated with additional materials to demonstrate desirable resilient properties . alternatively , the piston 20 can be mounted in a housing 32 of an assembly 4 or 6 outfitted with a suitable hydraulic or pneumatic chamber 28 ( shown in partial cutaway at fig1 ). such a housing 32 would provide a closed chamber , porting , valves and flow paths to a contained gas or liquid to define the travel range and resilient resistance to movement of the piston 20 . directing attention to fig3 a partial section view is shown to the boom assembly 8 as it appears when mounted in a typical main sail boom 18 . the housing 17 is particularly mounted in a boom 18 of circular or elliptical shape and secured with one or more pin fasteners that extend through the walls of the boom 18 and apertures 72 in an end cap 74 . a length of cable 19 extends through a series of washers 76 , resilient bushings 78 , a spring 80 and through an end cap 82 . the spring 80 and bushings 78 define the resilience of the assembly 8 and dampen any operating noise . the cable 19 is routed over a separately mounted pulley 21 that is secured to rotate within the boom 18 . an eyelet 84 fitted to the cable 19 couples to the rigging lines 10 . fig4 and 5 disclose another construction of the invention and wherein a resilient mast assembly 90 is shown . the assembly 90 provides an “ a frame ” 92 having upright frame members 94 and 96 that are coupled together at an apex cap 98 and a cross member 100 . the lower ends of the members 94 and 96 are mounted to pivot at couplers 102 secured to the deck of the boat 2 . the members 94 and 96 are held upright in conventional fashion with suitable guy lines ( not shown ). depending from the cap 98 is a mast cable 102 that is secured to a ring or “ eye ” fitting 104 . separately extending from the ring fitting 104 is a compression cable 106 that is resiliently biased at a mast post assembly 108 . the assembly 108 is secured at end plates 110 to the hull 112 and cabin roof 114 . the cable 106 is secured within a tubular housing 116 that is fitted to the plates 110 and through a series of resilient bushings 118 , washers 120 and a spring 122 . the assembly 108 provides a resilience on the order of 100 to 200 pounds and a range of motion of 5 to 8 inches . the boom 18 is separately secured to the ring fitting 104 with an appropriate coupler . an additional resilient assembly 4 can be secured to the opposite end to the boom 18 as desired . as necessary additional frame members of guy lines can restrict the movement of the mast and compression cables 102 and 106 relative to the framework 92 . the boom 8 however is resiliently restrained to the boat 2 in a fashion that provides two degrees of resilient motion to compensate for boat and sail movements . wind gusts are particularly countered by the ability of the assemblies 4 and 90 to flex and compensate for extraneous pressures on the main sail 13 . fig5 depicts an alternative mast post 130 wherein the spring 122 is replaced with a resilient elastomer core 132 . the core 132 also desirably deadens possible sounds that might emanate as the compression cable 106 extends and retracts from and into the assembly 130 . while the invention has been described with respect to a number of preferred assemblies and considered improvements or alternatives thereto , still other assemblies and rigging arrangements may be suggested to those skilled in the art . it is also to be appreciated that selected ones of the foregoing assemblies and features can be used singularly or can be arranged in different combinations to provide a variety of improved rigging assemblies for sailing craft . the foregoing description should therefore be construed to include all those embodiments within the spirit and scope of the following claims .
