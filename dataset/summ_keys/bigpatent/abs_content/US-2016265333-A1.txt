a method of homogenizing a production fluid from an oil well having one or more wellbores includes separating gas from the production fluid in a vertical or horizontal section of a well casing at a first location spaced from a heel portion of a wellbore , and injecting the separated gas into the production fluid at a second location spaced from the heel portion of the wellbore and provided downstream of the first location .
referring initially to fig1 , there is illustrated a system 10 constructed according to one preferred embodiment of the invention . according to this embodiment , the system 10 is installed in vertical wellbore 12 of a well , the wellbore 12 being lined with casing 14 . the system 10 includes a passive gas / liquid separation device 16 in the form of flow tube 18 which is located above the heel portion 20 of the well , which heel portion 20 connects the vertical wellbore 12 with a generally horizontal borehole 22 . the fluid flow 38 ( i . e ., liquid , gas slugs and water ) from horizontal borehole 22 reaches the heel 20 as shown , and rises upwardly in the vertical casing where it meets the flow tube 18 . at this location , the fluid enters the vertical flow tube 18 and proceeds upwardly along the spiral path defined by spiral baffle 24 . the system of fig1 includes one preferred form of gas / liquid separation device 16 in the form of spiral baffle , or auger 24 , positioned in flow tube 18 and defining a spiral path for the gas / liquid mix rising from the horizontal borehole 22 . the spiral shaped path of baffle 24 tends to separate the gas slugs 26 from the liquid medium by centrifugal forces imposed on the liquid , which forces cause the liquid portion to migrate radially outwardly from the center of baffle 24 , as the mix rises and increases in velocity . the lighter gas portion will remain closer to the center and enter central gas tube 28 via apertures 30 , to be directed into the annulus 32 defined between flow tube 18 and casing 14 . the gas portion in the center of baffle 24 may include a relatively lesser portion of liquid in the mix . as noted , as the gas / liquid mix rises up the spiral path of the gas / liquid separation baffle 24 , the heavier liquid portion migrates outwardly along the spiral path , and the gaseous portion enters apertures 30 in the center of the spiral baffle 24 and is directed into annulus 32 . annular packer 34 is provided with vent valve 36 , which is adapted to vent excess gas to the atmosphere in the event an excessive amount of gas is produced and accumulated in the annulus 32 to form a high pressure zone . in particular , as can be seen from the figures , liquid will enter the annulus 32 ; however a reduced flow rate due to a large “ settling area ” will allow the liquid and gas to separate by density differences . the separated liquid will be directed to the tubing , the gas will remain in the annulus , captured under the packer until reinjected into the tubing . it will be appreciated that the combination of the continuous rotational path of the fluids while traveling upwardly along the spiral path , and the progressively increasing velocity of the fluids as they rise upwardly , will cause radially outward migration of the heavier liquids ( i . e ., oil and water ) and retention of the most gaseous phase closer to the center as shown by arrow 23 . simultaneously , by the action of the spiral path , the gaseous slugs 26 will be broken up into smaller bubbles , which enter central gas flow tube 28 via inlet aperture ( s ) 30 . thereafter , as noted , the liquid phase of oil ( sometimes combined with water ) will proceed upwardly into production flow tube 18 , while the gaseous phase in the form of relatively smaller bubbles will migrate upwardly , or will be lifted by compressor 44 ( if required ) and then proceed to injection device 40 , which allows one - way flow of gas from annulus 32 into production flow tube 18 , preferably in a controlled manner , where the gases are mixed with the liquid phase in a dispersed and uniform manner . in the flow tube 18 , an optional electric submersible pump 42 can also be installed in flow tube 18 as shown in phantom lines in fig1 , to assist the production flow upward toward surface if required by the conditions prevailing in the well . annular packer 34 will contain the mostly gaseous medium formed by the dispersed slugs , if and until the pressure exceeds the pre - set pressure of relief valve 36 . should the pre - set pressure be exceeded , the relief valve 36 will permit the gaseous medium to escape into the annulus and rise to the surface as illustrated schematically by the arrow 35 shown in phantom lines . in fig1 , injection device 44 is positioned in the annulus 32 as shown , and arranged to communicate with the production flow tube 18 such that gas exiting central gas tube 28 can be directed into the annulus 32 , and then into the production flow tube 18 in a controlled manner and the form of relatively fine bubbles , at an elevated location immediately below packer 34 . thereafter , the merged fine gas bubbles and the production liquid mix is allowed to flow to elevated locations above packer 34 and proceed upwardly to the wellhead at the earth &# 39 ; s surface . as noted , depending upon the particular characteristics and conditions in the well , an optional compressor 44 can be positioned as shown in fig1 , in the annulus 32 to assist the upward movement of the predominantly gaseous medium exiting central gas tube 28 and entering annulus 32 via apertures 30 . compressor 44 comprises an artificial lift system that electrically drives multiple centrifugal stage impellers to increase the pressure and thereby lift the predominantly gaseous medium from annulus 32 . the compressor 44 may be powered by electric power provided from the surface . depending upon the circumstances and well completion conditions , the compressor can be in any of several forms . the steps of diffusing the gaseous slugs into predominantly fine gas particles , and then re - introducing them into the predominantly liquid phase of the production flow increases the flow rate of the produced fluid stream and maintains the continuous operational characteristics of the well . it is also noted that the assist provided by the optional compressor 44 promotes improved merging of the now dispersed gaseous medium with the predominantly liquid flow in the production flow tube 18 . as shown in fig1 , an electric submersible pump 42 can optionally be positioned in production flow tube 18 above compressor 44 to provide artificial lift to the predominantly liquid medium in flow tube 18 . in fig1 , the production flow tube 18 is open at the mouth 45 to receive fluids as depicted by arrows 46 . in fig1 , the fluid ( both liquid and gas ) at the mouth 45 of the flow tube 18 would generally be at a first pressure , designated as pgas / liquid . once the flow of liquid and gas slugs enters the flow tube 18 and gas / liquid separation device 16 as shown in fig1 , and the separation of the gas from the liquid takes place by the gas passing through the path of spiral baffle or auger 24 , the gas will rise in the wellbore annulus 32 and it will be ultimately trapped therewithin under an annular sealing device , such as packer 34 , or the like . since the pressure pgas of the gas in the annulus 32 , prior to re - entry into the flow tube 18 , by injection device 40 , is greater than the liquid pressure pliquid in the flow tube 18 , any relatively small amount of liquid in the annulus 32 will be redirected from the annulus 32 into the flow tube 18 , and then flow naturally within the flow tube 18 toward the surface in flow tube 18 along with the production flow . as the liquid rises in the flow tube 18 , the hydrostatic pressure will decrease primarily due to the change in height . as noted , the pressure of the liquid will be different at the various locations in the tubing string and an upper location will have a lower pressure than a deeper location as will be explained hereinbelow , using water as an example . referring again to fig1 , at a predetermined vertical distance above the mouth 44 of flow tube 18 , pgas will be greater than pliquid . at this location , the primarily gas flow in the annulus 32 below the packer 34 will be at a higher pressure than that of the medium in the flow tube 18 , which is comprised primarily of a liquid . the gas will then be directed via a controlled gas injection device 40 for injection into the liquid stream . as noted , the gas injection device 40 will control the rate of gas injection into the flow tube 18 , as shown schematically by arrows 46 in fig1 . the gas injection device 40 is a valve used in a gas lift system which controls the flow of lift gas into the production tubing conduit in a controlled manner . the gas injection device 40 , which can be in the form of an injection valve , is located in a gas lift mandrel 48 , which also provides communication with the gas supply in the tubing annulus 32 . gas lift mandrel 48 is a device installed in the tubing string and is shown schematically in fig1 . operation of the gas injection device 40 is determined by preset opening and closing pressures in the tubing of the annulus , depending upon the specific application . the gas lift injection device 40 or other suitable gas injection controlled metering device , or nozzle is preferably capable of providing specifically controlled metered gas flow into the liquid stream in the flow tube 18 in a manner to produce finely dispersed gas bubbles in the liquid stream . in particular , the gas injection device 40 allows one - way flow of gas from the high pressure zone of annulus 32 into flow tube 18 , as explained previously , due to the fact that pgas is greater than pliquid at such elevated location . any relatively small amount of liquid which is mixed with the gas in the annulus 32 will naturally flow back into the flow tube 18 through gas injection device 40 . injection device 40 preferably will be arranged to re - inject the gas into the tubing at the same rate that it is stripped out of the liquid / gas flow by the passive gas separation process of gas / liquid separation device 16 . a venting device such as vent valve 36 , is positioned preferably within the packer 34 to vent excess gas to the atmosphere in the event such an excessive amount of gas is produced and accumulated in the annulus 32 to form a high pressure zone . therefore , if the gas is not reinjected at the same rate that it is stripped , the gas will fill the annulus 32 until it reaches the stripped pressure . the passive gas / liquid separation system will no longer strip out the gas ; rather the gas will stay in solution with the liquid and will be injected into the tubing . referring now to fig2 - 3 , there is illustrated an alternative embodiment 100 of the inventive system , which includes passive gas / liquid separation device 102 in the form of flow tube 116 . wellbore 112 is lined with casing 114 in which flow tube 116 is positioned to form annulus 118 with casing 114 , as shown . in this embodiment , flow tube 116 is closed at its lowermost end by plug 120 . in principle , the operation of the embodiment of fig2 and 3 differs from the previous embodiment , but the objectives and results are similar . the tortuous apertures 124 in flow tube 116 receive and direct the liquid 126 containing gaseous slugs 128 into the flow tube 116 as shown , while the major portion of the gaseous medium is permitted to move upwardly into annulus 118 via apertures 124 . the flow tube 116 includes a central separator baffle 130 for further assistance and guidance of the liquid medium , the central baffle 130 being surrounded by circular baffle 132 as shown in fig2 and 3 . major portions of the gaseous slugs 128 are broken up while entering the flow tube 116 via tortuous apertures 124 , which are so configured as shown , as to encourage the liquid component to enter the circular baffle 132 , as shown schematically by arrows 134 . the gaseous medium is “ encouraged ” to move upwardly and outwardly toward annulus 118 as depicted schematically by arrows 136 , and the predominantly liquid flow is depicted by arrow 137 . fig3 is a cross - sectional view taken along lines 3 - 3 of fig2 , illustrating the escape of gaseous medium by arrows 136 which were previously in the form of gaseous slugs 128 , via tortuous apertures 124 and into annulus 118 . in particular , a controlled gas injection device 138 is positioned above compressor 140 and below packer 142 , which is provided with vent valve 144 as in the embodiment of fig1 and 2 . in all other respects , the uppermost structure and operation of the embodiment of fig2 and 3 are the same as the operation of the previous embodiments . referring now to fig4 , there is illustrated an enlarged cross - sectional view of a lowermost portion of yet another alternative embodiment 200 of the invention , in which the flow from a horizontal borehole of the well enters the tube 210 , which is closed at its lowermost end by integrally formed base plate 212 , the flow tube 210 including apertures 214 which create respective tortuous paths as depicted by arrows 216 , for separation of the gas from the liquid . this path causes the gas slugs to be broken up and to be stripped from the liquid while entering the annulus 218 formed between the flow tube 210 and the casing 220 . the gas is thus stripped from the liquid / gas mix and then permitted to accumulate in the annulus 218 , where it is reinjected into the flow tube 210 at the upper end ( not shown in fig4 ) in the same manner as described in connection with the previous embodiments . in all other respects , the operation and the remaining structure and function of the embodiment of fig4 , are the same as with the previous embodiments . referring now to fig5 , there is shown yet another alternative embodiment 300 of the invention , in which the passive gas / liquid separation device 324 is positioned in the horizontal borehole of the well . the system of fig5 is similar in most respects to the gas / liquid separation device system of fig1 and 2 , except that it is located in the horizontal borehole . the well completion system 300 is comprised of vertical borehole 310 provided with vertical casing 312 surrounding production flow tube 314 to form annulus 316 . horizontal borehole 322 is depicted schematically as being joined with vertical borehole 310 at heel 320 . located in horizontal borehole is a passive gas / liquid separation device 324 , which is structurally and functionally identical to the passive gas / liquid separation device shown in fig1 and 2 , including a spiral shaped baffle or auger 326 positioned and adapted to receive gaseous slug - laden fluids from the well through the horizontal borehole 322 , as depicted by arrows 328 and slugs 330 . the slug - laden fluids depicted by arrows 328 enter mouth 334 of the gas / liquid separation device 324 and proceed downstream to passively separate the gas components from the liquid components while breaking up the gaseous slugs into relatively smaller pluralities of bubbles . as in the system of fig1 and 2 , the gaseous slugs are broken up into smaller bubbles and exit flow tube 336 . thereafter the primarily gaseous medium is assisted by compressor 339 if needed , and then injected into vertical flow tube via controlled injection device 338 where it is mixed with the predominantly liquid medium passing through spiral shaped baffle or auger 326 as in the system disclosed in fig1 and 2 . the now homogeneous liquid / gas mixture flows with the assistance of electric submersible pump ( designated as “ esp ”) 340 and then to vertical flow tube 314 where it proceeds upwardly through surface as shown by arrow 342 . in all other respects , the operation of this embodiment is the same as the previous embodiments . referring now to fig6 , there is shown yet another alternative embodiment 400 of the invention , in which the passive gas / liquid separation device 410 is positioned in the horizontal borehole of the well . the passive gas / liquid separation device 410 of this system is similar to the system of fig2 and 6 . system 400 is comprised of a vertical borehole 412 provided with vertical casing 414 surrounding production flow tube 415 to form annulus 416 . horizontal borehole 422 is depicted schematically as being joined with vertical borehole 414 at heel 420 . located in horizontal borehole 422 is a passive gas / liquid separation device 410 which is structurally and functionally identical to the passive gas / liquid separation device shown in fig2 and 5 , including flow tube 426 containing central baffle 428 surrounded by circular baffle 430 . as described in connection with the embodiment of fig2 and 3 , the slug - laden fluids proceed from the well through horizontal borehole 422 as shown schematically by arrows 432 . as the fluids flow through the horizontal borehole 422 , the gaseous slugs 431 are made to pass through a series of tortuous paths where they are divided into a plurality of relatively smaller bubbles as the slugs are dispersed . the mostly gaseous medium then migrates toward annulus 434 and toward compressor 436 , and is then injected under controlled conditions by injection device 435 into the flow tube 426 where a homogeneous mix 438 of liquid and relatively smaller gas bubbles is produced . annulus packer seal 440 is positioned in the annulus and includes having a release vent valve 442 which permits release of the predominantly gaseous media in the event the pressure rises in annulus 434 exceeds a pre - set value . the resultant homogeneous mixture depicted by arrow 438 is then directed to surface . in all other respects , the passive gas / liquid separation system shown in fig6 is structurally and functionally the same as the corresponding system of fig2 and 3 . fig7 is a graph which illustrates the liquid and gas pressures in relation to the depth of the well , in feet , for the embodiments of fig1 - 6 . in particular , the liquid and gas conditions at two different depth locations identified respectively as “ upstream location 1 ” and “ downstream location 2 ” are shown in the graph .
