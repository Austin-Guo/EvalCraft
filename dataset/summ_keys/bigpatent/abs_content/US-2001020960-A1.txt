jet printer 100 is comprised of a line head 120 , a paper feed section 130 , a line feed section 140 , a paper tray 150 , and an electrical circuit section 160 installed in a cabinet 110 . the cabinet 110 is formed in the shape of a right - angled parallelepiped . a paper ejection slot 111 for the paper p is formed in one end of the cabinet 150 , and a tray inlet / outlet 112 for the paper tray 150 is formed in the other end of the cabinet 150 . the line head 120 contains four color cmyk ( cyan , magenta , yellow , black ) and nozzles not shown in the drawing are installed above the end of the paper ejection slot 111 to face downward . the paper feed section 130 is comprised of a paper feed guide 131 , paper feed roller 132 , 133 , a paper feed motor 134 , pulleys 135 , 136 , and belts 137 , 138 , and is installed below the edge of the paper ejection slot 111 . the paper feed guide 131 is formed a level plate shape and installed with specified open gaps below the line head 120 . the paper feed rollers 132 and 133 form a pair of rollers in mutual contact , and are installed on both sides of the paper feed guide 131 , namely on the side of the tray inlet / outlet 112 and the side of the paper ejection slot 111 . the paper feed motor 134 as shown in fig2 is installed below the paper feed guide 131 , and is linked to the paper feed rollers 132 , 133 by way of the pulleys 135 , 136 and the belts 137 , 137 . the line feed section 140 is comprised of the line feed roller 141 , line feed motor 142 and gear 143 , and is installed on the tray inlet / outlet 112 opposite the paper feed section 130 . the line feed roller 141 is formed in a roughly semicircular tubular shape and installed in proximity to the paper feed roller 132 on the tray inlet / outlet 112 side . the line feed motor 142 is installed above the line feed roller 141 , and is linked to the line feed roller 141 by the gear 143 . the paper tray 150 is formed in a box shape capable of storing a plurality of sheets of paper p for instance of a 4 size , and has a paper clamp 152 engaged with a spring 151 . the paper tray 150 is installed from below the line feed section 140 to the tray inlet / outlet 112 . the electrical circuit section 160 controls the driving of each section and is installed above the paper tray 150 . therefore , when using this type of ink - jet printer 100 , the user , after turning on the power to the ink - jet printer 100 , pulls out the paper tray 150 from the tray inlet / outlet 112 and presses a specified number of sheets of paper p inside the paper tray 150 . when the sheets of paper p are pressed in , the paper clamp 152 raises up the end portion of the paper p by means of the action of the spring 151 , and presses the paper p against the line feed roller 141 . the line feed motor 142 then drives and rotates the line feed roller 141 , and one sheet of paper p is fed to the paper feed roller 132 from the paper tray 150 . next , the paper feed rollers 132 , 133 are rotated by the driving action of the paper feed motor 134 , and the paper p fed from the paper feed roller 132 is fed to the paper feed guide 131 . the line head 120 then operating at a specified timing , emits droplets of ink from a nozzle to impact on the paper p and record characters and images formed of dots from the ink droplets . then , the paper p fed out from the paper feed roller 133 , is ejected from the paper ejection slot 111 . this process is repeated until the recording is complete . a block diagram showing the electrical circuit section 160 for recording and control in the ink -

control circuit 161 arranged in a record sequence , and sent to a correction circuit 162 for correction processing such as correcting irregularities in each nozzle , color correction , and γ correction . then signals such as for record data after correction are extracted from the signal processor - control circuit 161 according to external conditions , such as the nozzle no ., temperature , and input signal , and sent as drive signals to the head drive circuit 163 and each control circuit 164 . the head drive circuit 163 controls driving of the line heads 120 based on the drive signal . the control circuits 164 controls driving of the paper feed motor 134 , the line feed motor 142 , and the line head 120 for cleaning etc ., based on the drive signal . signals such as for record data are temporarily recorded in the memory 165 and extracted as needed . a block diagram showing a detailed view of the line head 120 and the head drive circuit of fig3 is shown in fig4 . the head drive circuit 163 is configured to perform time - shared driving and pnm modulation . the head drive circuit 163 is comprised of a tone counter 163 a , a converter 163 b , a serial - parallel converter 163 c and a data loader 163 d . as shown in fig5 the tone counter 163 a , is a counter for counting up the pnm ( pulse number modulation ) pulses . the converter 163 b compares the count value with the record data from the data loader 163 d , and outputs an “ h ” when the record data is higher than the count value . the serial - parallel converter 163 c , as shown in fig6 after processing in serial data the thermal element data to simultaneously drive nozzles at a certain number of time - drive divisions during one tone , converts the serial data into parallel data . the line head 120 is comprised by tiling of a plurality of head chips 121 each having one time -

division driven phase generator circuit 121 a and the data from the serial / parallel converter 163 c , and when the phase and data input to the and gate are both “ h ”, the switching element 121 c is turned on to drive the thermo element 121 b and emit the ink . a flat view and a bottom view showing the structure for a line head 120 for one color portion in the ink - jet printer 100 of fig1 are respectively shown in fig7 a and fig7 b . fig8 a is a cross sectional view taken along the lines a - a , and fig8 b is a cross sectional view taken along the lines b - b of fig7 b . a fragmentary , perspective view as seen from the bottom side is shown in fig9 . as these figures show , an ink supply hole 122 a is formed in a slit shape in the center of the line - shaped head frame 122 of the line head 120 . a plurality of head chips 121 formed of silicon plate are attached on the other side of the head frame 122 . the head chips 121 are formed in a staggered formation on both sides of the ink supply hole 122 a on the head frame 122 . as shown also in fig1 , a plurality of thermal elements 121 a are arrayed in a row on the ink supply hole 122 a side on the head chip 121 , and on the opposite side , a row of connecting elements 121 b are arrayed in a row paired with the thermal elements 121 a . in this example , the thermal elements 121 a are arrayed at 600 dpi . a switching circuit 121 c for performing time - division drive of the head chip 121 ( thermal element 121 a ) and ( logic ) gate circuits 121 d are respectively laid out between the connecting elements 121 b and the thermal elements 121 a . the temperature of the head chip 121 rises due to the ( ink ) emission operation but the top surface and side surface of the head chip 121 are immersed in ink so that the head chip 121 is directly cooled by the ink . a nozzle plate 124 having a plurality of nozzles 124 a are formed on the head chip 121 by way of a member 123 forming the flow path 123 b and the plurality of fluid compartments 123 a as shown in fig1 . in the member 123 , each fluid compartment 123 a houses thermal elements 121 a arrayed in the head chip 121 , and further , each flow path 123 b extends from the fluid compartments 123 a to the edge of the head chip 121 by means of light - sensitive plastic such as so - called dry photoresist . the nozzle plate 124 is made for example by electrotyping and receives anti - corrosive plating such as of gold or palladium to prevent corrosion caused by the ink and formed to prevent clogging of the ink supply holes 122 a and also so the nozzles 124 form one - to - one pairs with the thermal elements 121 b . in other words , the fluid compartments 123 a are connected by the flow paths 123 b formed in the member 123 and to the nozzles 124 a formed in the nozzle plate 124 . an ink tank 126 is attached to the other surface of the head frame 122 by way of the filter 125 . the filter 125 is formed to cover the ink supply holes 122 a and fulfills the job of preventing debris and clusters of ink material from the ink tank 126 from penetrating into the nozzle side 124 . the ink tank 126 is formed in a double layer by the bag 126 a and the outer cabinet 126 b . a spring member 126 c is placed between the bag 126 a and the outer cabinet 126 b to make the bag 126 a widen to the outer side . the ink is in this way subjected to a negative pressure , and the ink is prevented from naturally leaking away from the nozzle 124 . this negative pressure is further set to reduce the capillary action of the nozzle 124 a so that the ink can be prevented from being pulled in to the nozzle 124 a . an electrical wiring 127 madeof so - called fpc ( flexible printed circuit board ) is attached from above the head chip 121 , along the outer side of the head frame 122 to the outer circumferential surface of the ink tank 126 . the electrical wiring 127 is for supplying electrical power and electrical signals to the head chip 121 , and is connected to the connection terminal 121 of the head chip 121 . in the above structure , the ink is supplied from the ink tank 126 to the ink supply holes 122 a , and supplied by way of the flow path 123 b to the fluid compartment 123 a . here , the nozzles 124 a are formed in a circular shape , and the center of the ink surface is concave due to the negative pressure of the ink at the tip of the nozzle , creating the so - called meniscus effect . a drive voltage is applied to the thermal elements 121 b , and when air bubbles occur on the thermal element 121 b surface , ink particles are emitted from the nozzle 124 a . in the line head 120 , each head chip 121 has a specified number of first phase time - driven nozzles 124 a as shown in fig1 a , and contains a drive circuit 128 ( switching circuit 121 c and logic circuit 121 d explained in fig4 ) for driving these first phase nozzles . the first phase nozzles 124 a contained in each head chip 121 comprise one time - division driven block 129 . the head chip 121 of fig1 may also be comprised of a specified number of second phase or third phase nozzles 124 a shown as shown in fig1 b or fig1 c , and a drive circuit 128 for driving these nozzles . more specifically , besides each block 129 , being comprised of the second phase or in other words 16 nozzles on one head chip 121 as shown for example in fig1 , each head chip 121 contains a drive circuit 128 for 16 nozzles for nozzles from phase no . 1 through 16 or in other words for two blocks 129 . in the drive circuit 128 , phase nos . from 1 through 16 are assigned in sequence in the drive circuit 128 , the first phase is comprised of phase no . 1 through 8 , and a second phase is comprised of phase no . 9 through 16 . as shown in fig1 , the signal lines a 1 through a 8 are respectively connected to each phase of the drive circuit 128 , and each phase is connected to the control signal lines b 1 or b 2 . the nozzles 124 a for each phase are sequentially driven as shown in fig1 . in this way , the nozzle 124 a for each phase is sequentially driven and the power consumption can be reduced . in this case , each head chip 121 can be provided with the same , double or three times the number of nozzles per the number of phases as described above , and the nozzles for each block for one time - division driven phase , are driven by drive circuits 128 with identical structures on identical head chips 121 so that each head chip 121 including the drive circuit has an identical structure . a line head 120 can therefore be tiling structured , by arraying a plurality of head chips 121 of a single type , comprised of drive circuits 128 having identical circuit structures , so that the head chips 121 can be manufactured at low cost by being mass produced in large numbers , and the cost of the line head 120 and the ink - jet printer 10 is therefore reduced . a drawing showing the overall structure of the line head in the second embodiment of the ink - jet printer of this invention is shown in fig1 a and 16b . the line head 120 comprised of head chips 121 shown in fig1 a and 16b has nozzle regions that mutually overlap on both sides of each head chip 121 . this design is intended to prevent problems that typically occur in structures having no nozzle overlap as shown in fig1 a and 12b , where irregularities in ink emission amounts between head chips and errors in the impact position are brought about by characteristics of the no overlap nozzle structure and positioning errors , and are causes of the so - called banding noise . in other words , each head chip 121 in fig1 a , has a number of nozzles 124 a consisting of a number equal to an overlap portion added to the time - division drive first phase portion of nozzles , and contains drive circuits 128 for driving these nozzles . the nozzle 124 a of the head chip 121 a and the nozzle 124 a of the head chip 121 b on the other side are thus alternately used in sideways or vertical directions in the overlap region . in this way , the banding noise prone to occur between the two adjacent head chips 121 a and 121 b , is reduced and alleviated . the head chip 121 , as shown in fig1 b , may be comprised of a number of nozzles 124 a consisting of a number equal to an overlap portion added to a specified number in the time - division drive second phase portion and , drive circuits 128 to drive these nozzles . more specifically , besides each block 129 as shown for example in fig1 , being comprised of a number of nozzles consisting of an overlap portion ( 3 pieces ) of nozzles added to a first phase portion ( 6 pieces ) of nozzles contained on one head chip 121 or in other words being comprised of nine nozzles , each head chip 121 is further comprised of nine drive circuits ( not shown in the drawing ) for driving the nine nozzles . phase no . 1 through 6 are attached in sequence to each nozzle 124 a as shown in fig1 , and in that case the overlapping nozzles are assigned with phase no . from 1 through 3 the same as the overlapped nozzles . besides phase no . from 1 through 6 constituting the first phase , the respective signal lines a 1 through a 6 are connected to the corresponding drive circuits 128 for each phase , so that the nozzle 124 a for each phase is sequentially driven based on the signals shown in fig1 from the drive signal lines a 1 through a 6 . therefore , the nozzles 124 a that make up each phase are driven in sequence , and the power consumption can be reduced in this way , by each head chip 121 has a number of nozzles consisting of a number of overlap nozzles added to one or two times the phase number as described above , and each block nozzle comprising a time - division one phase portion , is driven by a drive circuit 128 contained on the same head chip 121 , so that each head chip 121 is comprised of identical drive circuits 128 . therefore , a line head 120 can therefore be tiling structured , by arraying a plurality of head chips 121 of a single type , comprised of drive circuits 128 having identical circuit structures , so that the head chips 121 can be manufactured at low cost by being mass produced in large numbers , and the cost of the line head 120 and the ink - jet printer 10 is therefore reduced . in the above described embodiment , the head chips 121 are comprised of a specified number of nozzles for a time - division driven one phase , two - phase or three phase portion , such as 16 nozzles for example for a two - phase portion , or may be comprised a specified number of nozzles of a time - division drive first phase portion or second phase portion , for example nine nozzle consisting of three overlap portion nozzles added to six nozzles of a first phase portion . however , this invention is not limited to the above examples , and each head chip may comprise a number of nozzles consisting of an integer multiple of the time - division driven number of phases or an integer multiple of the time - division driven number of phases added to the overlap portion of nozzles , and a line head may be configured by arraying a plurality of head chips of a single type comprised of identical type drive circuits . further , in the above embodiment , the drive circuit 128 on each head chip 121 was comprised of thermal elements as drive elements however this invention is not limited by this example and may for instance contain piezoelectric elements as drive elements .
