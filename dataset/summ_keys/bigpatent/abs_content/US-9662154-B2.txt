an intramedullary pin for insertion into the medullary space of the femur through the lateral compacta of the trochanter major . the pin has a proximal pin section and an adjoining distal pin section . each pin section includes one or more bores for one or more bone screws . the proximal pin section has at least one bore running obliquely to the longitudinal axis , so that bone screws can be inserted through the bore into the head of the femur , or a screw can be inserted in the antegrade direction through the bore . the distal pin section is at least partly straight and the proximal pin section has a curvature in the lateral - posterior direction .
fig1 - 3 depict an intramedullary pin 1 in three views . the intramedullary pin 1 has a proximal end 14 and a distal end 15 . the shaft of the pin 1 is generally cylindrical in shape . the proximal end 14 may be curved in a lateral - posterior direction , while the distal end 15 may be straight or at least partly straight . proximal and distal end planes of the pin may be rotated about 60 °- 110 °, preferably 70 °- 90 ° and in particular 80 ° relative to one another . in one embodiment , the radius is between about 300 - 1300 mm , preferably about 900 - 1200 mm and in particular about 1100 mm . the length of the proximal radius corresponds to the lateral contact surface with the cortex which is about 300 - 1000 mm , preferably about 600 - 800 mm , and in particular 700 mm . the length of the distal straight section may correspond to the depth to which the distal pin end penetrates into the distal spongiosa structure . the length may be about 35 - 70 mm , preferably about 40 - 60 mm , and in particular about 52 mm . the pin 1 , at the proximal end 14 , may be designed with a 120 ° antegrade bore 2 compatible with a locking screw having a thickness between about 3 . 9 - 6 . 0 mm , a cranial 130 ° recon bore 3 compatible with a headless screw that is about 6 . 5 mm thick . the 130 ° recon bore 3 may coincide medially with the 120 ° antegrade bore 2 . the pin 1 may further be designed with a caudal recon bore 4 which is approximately 130 ° and compatible with a headless screw that is about 6 . 5 mm thick , and an oval bore 5 for static and dynamic positioning of a locking screw that is about 3 . 9 - 6 . 0 mm thick . furthermore , a lateral bevel 9 is recognizable at the proximal end 14 . the orientation of the three bores 3 , 4 , 5 allows for a combination of possibilities for locking the intramedullary pin , where antegrade locking has particular importance . a lateral opening 2 for the intramedullary pin approximately coincides with the insertion direction of the antegrade screw . if only one screw is set proximally , no further skin incision is therefore necessary . at the distal end 15 , two bores 6 and 7 extend transverse to the pin &# 39 ; s axis 18 and parallel to one another . an anterolateral bore 8 which is rotated through about 25 ° relative to the parallel bores 6 and 7 is shown at the distal end 15 . the angle formed between the anterolateral bore 8 and the parallel bores is preferably between about 45 ° and 10 °, where 0 ° corresponds to the frontal plane or the plane of two standard locking screws . a feature of the configuration of the three bores lies in the combination of the possibilities for locking . in addition to the generally known standard locking , the third bore 8 is present between the two standard bores . by locking the pin with three screws , axial stability is achieved . this ensures that the position of the distal pin end is fixed and the pin cannot be displaced on the screws . the 25 ° angle of the axial blocking screw may prevent the screw from injuring important soft tissues during insertion . this can occur , for example , if the screw is inserted in the sagittal direction ( 90 °). the locking screws may be present at a distance of about 30 mm away from one another . special formations at the tip 16 of the pin 1 allows the pin 1 to be tapped without rotation into the spongiosa in the distal femur region so as to be secured , preventing rotation even without locking by means of a screw . the tip 16 of the pin 1 may have , in a radial section , differing from the circular shape ( cylindrical ) of the body of the pin 1 , special tip surfaces , in particular concave notches or planar surfaces . in these embodiments , subsequent , arbitrary or involuntary rotation is not possible . fig4 a and 4 b depict an embodiment of the tip 16 at the distal end 15 of the pin 1 in two views . the tip 16 may have , in a radial section , differing from the circular shape , special tip surfaces 13 , in particular three planar surfaces , having a length of about 10 - 40 mm , preferably about 15 - 25 mm and in particular about 20 mm . the total length of the tip 16 may be about 20 - 50 mm , preferably about 25 - 35 mm and in particular 30 mm . bore 7 is shown near the tip 16 of the distal end 15 . fig5 a and 5 b depict another embodiment of the tip 16 at the distal end 15 of the pin 1 in two views . the tip 16 may have , in a radial section , differing from the circular shape , special tip surfaces 13 , in particular three concave notches , having a length of about 10 - 40 mm , preferably about 15 - 25 mm and in particular about 20 mm , and a radius 17 of about 4 - 10 mm , preferably about 5 - 8 mm and in particular about 6 mm . the total length of the tip 16 is about 20 - 50 mm , preferably about 25 - 35 mm and in particular about 30 mm . fig6 a and 6 b depict another embodiment of the tip 16 at the distal end 15 of the pin 1 in two views . the tip 16 may have , in a radial section , differing from the circular shape , special tip surfaces 13 , in particular four concave notches , which have a length of about 10 - 40 mm , preferably about 15 - 25 mm and in particular about 20 mm , and a radius 17 of about 4 - 10 mm , preferably about 5 - 8 mm and in particular about 6 mm . the total length of the tip 16 is about 20 - 50 mm , preferably about 25 - 35 mm and in particular about 30 mm . fig7 shows the proximal end 14 of the pin 1 viewed in a proximal to distal direction . a lateral bevel 9 , discussed previously , may form an angle at the lateral - proximal end relative to the axial pin axis 18 of between about 10 ° to 60 °, preferably about 40 °. a cylindrical recess 12 may have a thread 11 , and a positioning groove 10 on the medial side of the proximal end 14 , are shown . the bevel 9 which interrupts the transition and the contour matching between the target bow and pin 1 is preferably formed laterally at the proximal end 14 of the pin 1 . in the case of an anterior - posterior x - ray photograph , the end of the pin 1 can be easily and clearly detectable . this simplifies the surgery and leads to safer use and a shorter operation time . the pin &# 39 ; s entry point is on the lateral surface of the trochanter major . this lateral surface can be palpated particularly in slim patients . this means that the surface is covered only by a thin layer of skin . through the lateral entry point of the pin 1 , it is necessary to prevent the soft tissue from being irritated by the proximal end 14 of the pin 1 . an advantage of the bevel 9 is that the bevel 9 may ensure that the proximal end 14 fits the lateral cortex wall with a matching contour . this may prevent irritation of the soft tissue . while the distal pin section has , at least partly , no curvature at all , the proximal pin section may run in the lateral posterior direction when it is inserted into the medullary space through the lateral compacta of a trochanter major . the groove 10 which fixes the rotation of the pin 1 on the target bow is preferably present on the medial side of the proximal end 14 . the cylindrical recess 12 into which the diametrically opposite shaft of a connecting screw can penetrate between target bow and pin 1 is present at the proximal end 14 . consequently , the pin axis 18 is aligned coaxially with the target bow , and the thread 11 exerts only contact pressure . although the present invention and its advantages have been described in detail , it should be understood that various changes , substitutions and alterations can be made herein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims . moreover , the scope of the present application is not intended to be limited to the particular embodiments of the process , machine , manufacture , composition of matter , means , methods and steps described in the specification . as one of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate from the disclosure of the present invention , processes , machines , manufacture , compositions of matter , means , methods , or steps , presently existing or later to be developed that perform substantially the same function or achieve substantially the same result as the corresponding embodiments described herein may be utilized according to the present invention . accordingly , the appended claims are intended to include within their scope such processes , machines , manufacture , compositions of matter , means , methods , or steps .
