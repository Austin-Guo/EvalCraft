this invention relates to load adjustment systems for coater blades . such structures of this type , generally , employ the use of an actuator assembly to control cross - direction coatweight profiles .
with reference first to fig1 there is illustrated a cross - sectional view of a conventional blade coater assembly 2 . assembly 2 includes , in part , paper web 4 , backing roll 6 , coating distribution header 8 , coater blade / mount assembly 10 , coating film 12 on paper web 4 , baffle 14 , and trough 16 . during the operation of assembly 2 , the paper sheet or web 4 , that is being coated , runs upon the surface of backing roll 6 . the coating is piped to a distribution header 8 and is applied to the web 4 as it passes underneath blade 10 . blade 10 doctors excess coating off of web 4 to leave a thin coating film 12 , the thickness of which is exaggerated in the drawing . coating not applied to the web 4 , flows over a baffle 14 and is collected in a trough 16 for reuse . it should be noted that the application of coating 12 to web 4 in the manner described above , is known as &# 34 ; short dwell &# 34 ;, but is not the only means used to apply a coating to web 4 . another method is to have a second applicator or metering roll ( not shown ) at or beneath backing roll 6 . this metering roll forms a nip ( not shown ) between backing roll 6 and the metering roll and at the same time is partly immersed in a vat ( not shown ) of coating . as paper web 4 passes through the nip , web 4 picks up the coating of film carried on the surface of the metering roll , in a manner analogous to a rotary printing press . however , regardless of the coating application method used , a blade is employed to scrape off excess coating as shown in fig1 . a closeup view of a conventional mounting / clamping / loading assembly 10 is shown in fig2 . however , it is to be understood that the orientation of fig2 is reversed from that of fig1 . as shown in fig2 assembly 10 includes , in part , blade 12 , blade clamping hose 14 , adjusting screw 16 , thrust bar 18 , base 20 , and hand wheel or motor 22 . more particularly , blade 12 is clamped all along its length at one edge by inflatable hose 14 . adjusting screws 16 are equally spaced along the length of blade 12 to push on thrust bar 18 to adjust the contact force between one edge of blade 12 and moving web 4 ( fig1 ). this enables pointwise control of the amount of coating 12 ( fig1 ) applied to web 4 . adjusting screws 16 may be turned by hand wheels 22 or they may be motorized for automatic control via a conventional computer setup . the present invention is shown in fig3 a and 3b . fig3 a is a cross - sectional view that illustrates a single unit , pneumatically actuated coater blade loading assembly 100 . assembly 100 includes , in part , conventional blade 112 , conventional blade clamping hose 114 , inflatable profiling tube 116 , channel 118 , base 120 , conventional bracket 121 , pneumatic fluid supply line 122 , backing bar 123 , positioning rod 124 , and positioning rod fasteners 126 . channel 118 , base 120 , bracket 121 , backing bar 123 and rod 124 , preferably , are constructed of any suitable metallic material . tube 116 , preferably , is constructed of any suitable elastomeric material . as discussed before with respect to fig2 coater blade 112 is clamped along its base by inflatable hose 114 . but to load the working edge of blade 112 against paper web 4 ( fig1 ), the present invention dispenses with adjusting screws 16 and the hand wheels or motors 5 ( fig2 ) necessary to turn screws 16 . the present invention instead employs an inflatable profiling tube 116 contained within channel 118 . also , a backing bar 123 is mounted in place using positioning rods 124 and fasteners 126 located at equal intervals along the length of blade 118 . positioning rods 124 appear almost identical in function to the adjusting screws 16 used in the prior art ( fig2 ), but the number of positioning rods 124 is fewer . preferably , only one positioning rod 124 for every two or three widthwise control zones will be employed in the present invention . conversely , in the conventional blade coater assembly 2 , there is one adjusting screw 16 for each control zone . backing bar 123 is not used for profiling purposes , but is made movable only to enable the installation and control range adjustment of different - sized profile tubes 116 . fig3 b illustrates a front view of inflatable profiling tube 116 . in particular , fig3 b shows how profile tube 116 is partitioned off into separate control chambers 117 , each individually pressurized by its own pneumatic fluid supply line 122 . any suitable pneumatic fluid or gas can be used , but air is preferred . the view of fig3 b also shows chambers 117 being parallelogram - shaped and diagonally oriented . if chambers 117 are arranged straight up and down , i . e ., normal to the axis of profile tube 116 , the force applied to blade 112 may have sharp discontinuities between separate chambers 117 . however , it is to be understood that this diagonal orientation of chambers 117 may not be necessary for a relatively thick blade 112 that has a longitudinal stiffness sufficient to &# 34 ; bridge over &# 34 ; variations in the applied force . fig4 a and 4b show another embodiment of a pneumatically actuated coater blade loading assembly 200 with a stiffening strip 202 incorporated into profiling tube 116 . it is to be understood that assembly 200 includes all the parts of assembly 100 except for the addition of stiffening strip 202 incorporated into profiling tube 116 . strip 202 , preferably , is constructed of any suitable metallic and / or polymeric material . more particularly , as shown in fig4 a , strip 202 is bonded directly to the outer face of profile tube 116 by conventional bonding techniques . strip 202 further smooths and provides a more even distribution of the force applied to blade 112 by assembly 200 than the unmodified profiling tube 116 of fig3 a and 3b . in this manner , chambers 117 ( fig4 b ) may or may not be diagonally oriented because strip 202 adjusts for &# 34 ; bridge over &# 34 ; variations in the applied force . with respect to the present invention , hand wheel or motor 22 and adjusting screws 16 ( fig2 ) are replaced by an inflatable profile tube 116 ( fig3 a , 3b , 4a and 4b ) that pushes against blade 112 to load blade 112 against the moving paper web 4 ( fig2 ). tube 116 is separated into a series of short chambers 117 . chambers 117 are individually pressurized to create the desired cross - machine ( widthwise ) blade load profile . the control zone width ( the length of the individual chambers 117 ) can be as small as one - half of an inch . it is to be understood that conventional transducers may be attached to convert electronic or optical control outputs to pneumatic signals in order to operate assemblies 100 and 200 . thus , assemblies 100 and 200 have virtually no moving parts . consequently , they are simple to maintain and cost far less than the previously discussed prior art systems . once given the above disclosure , many other features , modifications or improvements will become apparent to the skilled artisan . such features , modifications or improvements are , therefore , considered to be a part of this invention , the scope of which is to be determined by the following claims .
