as illustrated in the accompanying drawings for purpose of illustration , the present invention resides in an automobile reflector assembly referred to by the reference number 10 in fig1 - 3 , and by the reference number 12 in fig4 - 6 . the design of the present invention is so effective that in some models , the number of led &# 39 ; s required for each assembly is only one quarter of those required in existing led cluster models . with reference to fig1 and 2 , a first automobile reflector assembly 10 embodying the present invention is shown . the assembly 10 includes a base 14 in which rests a circuit board 16 having a plurality of led &# 39 ; s 18 . the base 14 may be filled with an epoxy that holds the circuit board 16 in place , and serves to direct heat away from the led &# 39 ; s 18 . due to the low number of the led &# 39 ; s 18 , neither a heat sink nor such epoxy has been found to be necessary , however . it will be noted that the led &# 39 ; s 18 are not aggregated in a cluster , but rather spread across the surface of the circuit board 16 . the number of led &# 39 ; s 18 in each grouping depends upon the nature of the lighting assembly 10 , as larger assemblies and those which require more light emission will include more led &# 39 ; s 18 , whereas smaller assemblies will require less . regardless , the number of led &# 39 ; s 18 required for the present invention is substantially less than that used in current models . a reflector 20 is disposed over the led &# 39 ; s 18 . the reflector 20 includes a plurality of apertures 22 which are sized to accept each led 18 , or grouping of led &# 39 ; s 18 , therethrough so that the led &# 39 ; s 18 are disposed adjacent to reflective surfaces of the reflector 20 . the reflector 20 is configured such that a depression 24 surrounds each light led or cluster of led &# 39 ; s 18 . preferably , each depression 24 has a width , or angle , selected to be less than an angle of illumination of the led or cluster of led &# 39 ; s 18 so light reflection and dispersion is facilitated . typically , as illustrated , each depression 24 is generally conical in configuration . the inner reflective surface of these conical depressions 24 have interruptions 26 , so as to form a non - uniform reflective surface . each conical depression 24 may include a plurality of protrusions 26 , illustrated as hemispherical bumps , which are arranged to maximize the reflective surface of the reflector 20 . although the depressions 24 are illustrated as being generally conical , it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the depressions can have other configurations as well . additionally , the interruptions 26 need not be hemi - spherical bumps , but can be serrations , or even indentations or recesses , such as dimples . the important aspect of the present invention is that the depressions 24 have such interruptions 26 so as to maximize the reflective surface thereof . a lens 28 is disposed over the reflector 20 and light emitting diodes 18 , and attaches to the base 14 so as to house the circuit board 16 , led &# 39 ; s 18 and reflector 20 . the lens 28 can be fixed to the base 14 , such as by adhesives or the like . as shown in fig4 and 5 , bolts 30 may extend through apertures 32 and 34 of the lens 28 and base 14 , respectively , and into corresponding apertures of the vehicle to hold the assembly 10 in place on the vehicle . a gasket 36 can be placed between the lens 28 and base 14 to prevent water and other corrosive materials from entering into the assembly 10 , as illustrated in fig5 . the lens 28 is preferably comprised of ultraviolet stabilized lexan or other appropriate glass or plastic material . the lens 28 may be of a standard and flat construction , as illustrated in fig3 . however , the lens 28 in a particularly preferred embodiment includes multiple dome - like bubbles 38 which overlie each conical depression 24 and led 18 or grouping of led &# 39 ; s 18 . each dome 38 includes a central dimple lens 40 , or several dimples lenses 40 corresponding to each led 18 . for example , the lens 28 illustrated in fig1 includes a large central dome 38 having four dimple lenses 40 corresponding with the grouping of four led &# 39 ; s 18 disposed in the central conical depression 24 . the surrounding domes 38 only include one central dimple lens 40 each , which corresponds with a single led 18 positioned thereunder . with reference now to fig6 a cross - sectional view of the domed lens 28 is shown . as can be seen from this illustration , the domes 38 arch above the otherwise planar surface of the lens 28 . each central dimple lens 40 extends downwardly into the assembly 10 . each dome 38 includes ridges 42 which encircle each dimple lens 40 in a concentric fashion so that each ridge 42 is spaced from the adjoining ridge . the dimple lens 40 and ridges 42 are intended to reflect the light emanating from the led back into the assembly 10 or 12 and onto the reflector 20 . the interruptions 26 on the surface of the depressions 24 redirect the reflected light back through the lens 28 so as to simulate the look of multiple led &# 39 ; s 18 and effectively disperse the light . this results in the lens 28 effectively glowing due to the redirected , reflected , and dispersed led light . thus , very few led &# 39 ; s 18 are required to illuminate the lens 28 . another advantage of the dome configuration of the lens 28 is that it significantly increases the overall strength of the lens 28 so that it resists breakage . such breakage typically occurs in conventional automobile lights when the automobile strikes another object , such as another car , or loose objects on the road strike the lenses . as can be appreciated by the reader , this significantly impacts the safety of the vehicle . the department of transportation regulations that were written in the 1970 &# 39 ; s , and updated in the 1980 &# 39 ; s , to require that the color of light emanating from such tail , clearance marker , or automobile signal lights be red or amber depending on the light . the present invention contemplates using led &# 39 ; s 18 which emit red , such as for tail lights , or amber , for side marker lights . the lens 28 can thus be clear . while this may desirable for cosmetic purposes , it also serves as a safety feature . for example , if the battery goes dead and the lights are inoperable , light from a trailing vehicle will enter and exit through the clear lens and be reflected from the reflector of the assembly 10 much easier than through a red or amber lens . although the led &# 39 ; s 18 have been described as extending upwardly through apertures 22 formed in the depressions 24 of the reflector 20 , the led &# 39 ; s 18 can also be positioned above the reflector 20 , and directed downwardly towards the depression 24 , as illustrated in fig6 . an electrical lead 44 , or support , would position the led &# 39 ; s 18 over the depressions 24 such that light 46 emitted from the led &# 39 ; s 18 would hit the reflective surface , and interruptions 26 of the depression 24 of the reflector 20 and be directed upwardly towards the lens 28 . as described above , the interruptions 26 , as well as the configuration of the domed lens 28 , will cause the light 46 to be dispersed , or concentrated , as desired in order that the proper emission of light from the assembly 10 or 12 will be realized . although dispersion of the light is created , causing the lens 28 to glow , department of transportation regulations also require that the light be focused at certain points , particularly at the center of the lens 28 . accordingly , a cluster of led &# 39 ; s 18 is often formed in the middle of the assembly 10 or 12 , and the enlarged dome 38 present with dimple lenses 40 causing the concentration of light at these points . the present invention provides many advantages over existing led cluster lighting assemblies . the assemblies 10 and 12 of the present invention are considerably less expensive than existing assemblies due to the fact that fewer led &# 39 ; s are required . although the assemblies 10 and 12 use fewer led &# 39 ; s , there is an overall increase in the amount of uniform light emitted from the assembly 10 or 12 due to the use of the reflector 20 and the dome - like lens 28 . the reflector 20 and lens 28 also increase the viewing angle of the light from the assembly 10 or 12 , such that visibility is seen from a side angle of the assembly 10 or 12 , and not only at a direct angle of the assembly . although several embodiments have been described in detail for purposes of illustration , various modifications may be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention . accordingly , the invention is not to be limited except as by the appended claims .
