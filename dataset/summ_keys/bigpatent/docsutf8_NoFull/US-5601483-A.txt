in fig1 an exemplary embodiment of the invention is labeled in its entirety with the number 10 . the power tool 10 comprises an electric motor 16 , arranged inside a motor housing 14 , the motor shaft 18 of which , projecting into the adjacent gear drive housing 12 , drives a pinion 20 of a bevel gear drive , the output gear 22 of which drives a hollow spindle 24 mounted in the gear drive housing 12 . one end of the hollow spindle 24 projects outward from the gear drive housing 12 and is configured as a counterflange 26 with which is associated an external clamping flange 28 to clamp a tool 29 located between them , which in the example shown is a grinding disk . a quick clamping device which has a tension spindle 36 , coaxial with the hollow spindle 24 , that is joined integrally to the clamping flange 28 is provided in order to allow manual clamping - and unclamping of the tool 29 . the tension spindle 36 can be displaced in the axial direction by means of a displacement unit via a clamping lever 74 that can pivot about an axis 80 . the hollow spindle 24 has a first section 25 within which is arranged a pusher plate 44 that is held nonrotatably on the hollow spindle 24 by two brackets 48 engaging laterally in grooves 46 of the hollow spindle 24 . the pusher plate 44 is braced against a pusher element 42 lying below it . adjoining the first upper section 25 of the hollow spindle 24 is a second section 27 of the hollow spindle , forming an internal shoulder 40 . enclosed between the pusher element 42 and internal shoulder 40 are spring elements 38 by means of which the pusher element 42 is pushed upward in the direction of the pusher plate 44 . the pusher element 42 has internal threads 35 into which the tension spindle 36 can be threaded with external threads 33 provided at its upper end . arranged between the tool 29 and the outer clamping flange 28 is an intermediate flange 32 that projects by means of a polygon 34 into the second section 27 of the hollow spindle 24 , in order to lock the intermediate flange 32 positively on the hollow spindle 24 . arranged between the intermediate flange 32 and the outer clamping flange 28 is a spring washer 37 that is depicted in the right half of the tension spindle 36 , compressed between the intermediate flange 32 and the counterflange 38 . positive engagement elements 30 , which can for example be configured as claws engaging in corresponding depressions or as end serrations , are provided between the intermediate flange 32 and the counterflange 28 . once positive engagement is produced in this way between the intermediate flange 32 and the counterflange 28 , the counterflange 28 is therefore also fastened , positively and therefore nonrotatably , to the hollow spindle 24 by means of the polygon 34 engaging positively into the hollow spindle 24 . in the position depicted [ in the ] right half of the hollow spindle 24 , the tool is thus held between the two flanges 26 , 28 or the intermediate flange 32 located between them ; the tension spindle 36 , joined by threading to the pusher element 42 , generates , by means of the spring elements 38 enclosed between them , an axial tension by means of which the flanges 26 , 32 , 28 are pressed together , so that the tool 29 is nonrotatably clamped . to allow manual changing of the tool 29 , the tension spindle 36 can be pivoted outward , by pivoting the clamping lever 74 from a clamping position 72 , in which the clamping lever 74 lies against the gear drive housing , outward and away from the gear drive housing 12 in the direction of the arrow 68 into a released position indicated by the number 70 . provided at its first end 78 , at which the clamping lever 74 is pivotably fastened to the shaft 80 , is an eccentric element 66 against which rests , via a cam lobe 64 , a pusher stud 52 which is pushed via spring elements 56 toward the eccentric element 66 . the spring elements 56 are clamped between a shoulder 58 of the pusher stud 52 and a disk 54 that is movable in the gear drive housing 12 and , in the clamped position 72 , is held against the pusher stud 52 by a snap ring at a distance from the hollow spindle 24 . the disk 54 is configured as a brake disk , since its underside , which is configured as a friction surface 53 , is pressed upon displacement of the pusher stud 52 toward the pusher plate 44 by the pressure of the spring elements 56 onto the end surface 55 of the hollow spindle 24 in order to decelerate the latter . with the clamping lever 74 in the clamped position 72 as illustrated , the pusher stud 52 has its cam lobe 64 resting against the eccentric element , so that the lower end surface of the pusher stud 52 , which is configured as an additional friction surface 51 facing the pusher plate 44 lying below it , is lifted by the surface of the pusher plate 44 that is also configured as a friction surface 50 . if the clamping lever 74 is then pivoted in the direction of the arrow 68 out of the clamped position 72 into the released position 70 , the pusher stud 52 is then displaced , by means of the cam lobe 64 resting against the eccentric element 66 , downward toward the pusher plate 44 . as a result , firstly the disk 54 is pressed against the end surface 55 of the first section 25 of the hollow spindle 24 , so that the hollow spindle 24 is decelerated in response to the spring elements 56 . additional deceleration occurs by the fact that as the pusher element 52 is pushed farther downward as the clamping lever 74 moves into the released position 70 , the two friction surfaces 50 , 51 are also pressed together . the result of a positive connection 46 between pusher plate 44 and hollow spindle 24 is to prevent relative rotation between them . simultaneously , the axial displacement of the pusher plate 44 causes the tension spindle 36 , that is threaded together with the pusher element 42 located below it , to be displaced outward , so that the clamping flange 28 is lifted away from the intermediate flange 32 and the positive lock 30 between the intermediate flange 32 and the clamping flange 28 is abolished . in this position , the clamping flange 28 can then be manually rotated , without the aid of a tool , in order to unscrew the tension spindle 36 out of the pusher element 42 and allow the tool to be changed . once a new tool has been inserted , the clamping flange 28 , with the tension spindle 36 rigidly joined thereto , is once again screwed as far as possible into the pusher element . then the clamping lever 74 is moved back into the clamping position 72 , as a result of which positive locking 30 occurs between the intermediate flange 32 and the clamping flange 28 , and therefore the clamping flange 28 is also positively secured against rotation on the hollow spindle 24 by means of the polygon 34 of the intermediate flange 32 , and the tool 29 is nonrotatably clamped between the flanges 26 , 32 , 28 . in the clamped position 74 , the friction surface 51 of the pusher stud 52 is also lifted away from the friction surface 50 of the pusher plate 44 so that the frictionally engaged locking of the hollow spindle 24 , which occurs with the clamping lever 74 in the released position 70 , is abolished and the hollow spindle 24 can thus , in the clamped position , be driven in order to drive the tool 29 . the pusher stud 52 is positively secured against rotation to the machine housing 12 by a transverse stud 60 , which passes through a transverse bore of the pusher stud 52 and is held in axially displaceable fashion in two opposing grooves 62 of the machine housing 12 . the motor 16 can be switched on and off by means of a switch 110 ( cf . fig3 ) that can be actuated by a link rod 82 which extends parallel to the motor shaft 18 perpendicular to the axial direction 99 of the hollow spindle 24 . the link rod 82 is guided next to the motor 16 in the motor housing 14 and in the gear drive housing 12 , and can be displaced in the lengthwise direction 101 of the link rod 82 by means of an external slider 96 , which is fastened in snap - locked fashion , with a projection 100 , in an opening 98 of the link rod 82 . with the link rod 82 in the position shown in fig1 in which the link rod is in its position remote from the shaft 80 of the clamping lever 74 , the switch 110 and thus the motor 16 are turned off . however , when the link rod is displaced out of the deactivated position shown in fig1 toward the axis 80 of the clamping lever 74 , the switch 110 is actuated and the link rod is located in an activated position shifted toward the axis 80 ( if the movement of the switch 110 is controlled in the usual manner by a cardioid mechanism , the link rod is displaced from the position advanced maximally toward the axis 80 , under the action a spring 118 that is located on the switch 110 , slightly back toward the deactivated position ). firstly to ensure that with the link rod 82 in the activated position , the clamping lever 74 cannot be pivoted out of the clamped position 72 in the direction of the arrow 68 , and secondly to allow the motor 16 to be switched on only when the clamping lever 74 is in its clamped position 72 , the link rod 82 has at its end facing the axis 80 two first projections 86 ( cf . fig2 to 4 ), with which are associated corresponding first recesses 84 in the first end 78 of the clamping lever 74 , into which the first projections 86 can be slid when displaced in the lengthwise direction 101 . in addition , the clamping lever 74 has in the region of its free end 76 a second recess 88 into which a second projection 90 , projecting from the link rod 82 in the lengthwise direction 101 , can be slid when the clamping lever 74 is in its clamped position 72 . provided beneath the second recess 88 of the clamping lever 74 is a projection 92 that extends downward perpendicular to the orientation of the second recess 88 and thus projects toward the gear drive housing 12 . in the power tool according to the invention , activation of the motor 16 by displacement of the link rod 82 in the lengthwise direction 101 is prevented if the clamping lever 74 is pivoted even slightly out of the clamped position 72 shown in fig1 into a slightly open position ( cf . fig2 ). this is achieved by a combination of the first openings 84 of the clamping lever 74 , which interact with the first projections 86 of the link rod 82 ; the second recess 88 which interacts with the second projection 90 of the link rod 82 ; and the projection 92 , which prevents the link rod 82 from advancing , in the position shown in fig2 toward the axis 80 . although the projection 92 is not absolutely necessary to achieve secure interlocking of the clamping lever 74 in the clamped position , in order to prevent opening of the clamping lever 74 when the motor is switched on , the additional projection 92 on the clamping lever 74 prevents the link rod 82 from being advanced into the activated position if the clamping lever 74 is pivoted even very slightly out of the clamped position 72 shown in fig1 . in addition , this projection 92 prevents the link rod 82 from being moved forward if the projections 86 are damaged by wear and the clamping lever 74 is slightly raised . in the clamped position 72 shown in fig1 the projection 92 of the clamping lever 74 engages into a groove 94 of the clamping lever 74 ( cf . fig3 and 4 ), so that the clamping lever 74 is pivoted in completely against the motor housing 14 and in this position , the link rod 82 can be moved in the lengthwise direction 101 into the activated position . as may now be gathered from fig3 and 4 , the link rod 82 is configured in two parts . it consists of a front part 102 , facing the axis 80 , which is connected in snap - lock fashion to a rear part 104 by means of a snap - lock element 108 which engages in a slot 106 of the front part 102 . this facilitates assembly of the link rod 82 . the front part 102 of the link rod can be pushed from the rear through the motor housing 14 , past the fan for the motor 16 , into the gear drive housing 12 , in which it is laterally guided in a manner not shown further . the rear part 104 of the link rod can then be snap - locked to the front part 102 and thus attached thereto . the link rod 82 is also laterally guided in the motor housing 14 , in a manner not depicted . the rear part 104 of the link rod has an end 112 , bent at a right angle , in which a receptacle 114 is provided into which a switch pin 116 of the switch 110 engages . the switch pin 116 is also pushed by the spring 118 toward the deactivated position . as a result , the entire link rod 82 is pushed toward the deactivated position , so that even a slight displacement of the slider 96 in a direction away from the axis 80 is sufficient to move the link rod 82 into the deactivated position and actuate the switch 110 to switch off the motor 16 . with the link rod 82 in the deactivated position shown in fig1 and 2 , the clamping lever 74 can then be pivoted in the direction of the arrow 68 in order to open the quick clamping device , as a result of which a tool 29 , still coasting after the motor 16 has previously been switched off , is simultaneously decelerated , since the two friction surfaces 50 , 51 are pressed against one another by displacement of the pusher stud 52 by the eccentric element 66 . when the clamping lever 74 has been pivoted completely into the released position indicated with the number 70 in fig1 the hollow spindle 24 , as described earlier , is locked by frictional engagement , and the tool 29 can be replaced in the manner described earlier . only when the clamping lever 74 has again been moved completely into the clamped position 72 , so that a tool 29 just inserted is firmly clamped , can the link rod 82 be moved back into its activated position in order to switch on the motor . when the motor 16 is switched on , opening of the clamping lever 74 is not possible because it is interlocked with the link rod 82 . both the front part 102 and the rear part 104 of the link rod 82 are made of an insulating material , preferably a fiber - reinforced plastic .
