fig1 is a side view of a rotary wing aircraft 10 having a fuselage 12 on the top of which a rotor 14 is arranged . a rudder 18 is fastened on the tail 16 . as can be noted in particular from fig5 the rotor 14 consists of a rotor head 20 on which four rotor blades 22 are mounted . the rotor head 20 is developed as an air - suction connection 24 which is open in the upward direction and within which an impeller 26 that is rotatably driven around the axis of the rotor head 20 is mounted and draws air in from above . stationary guide vanes 28 arranged on the pressure side of the impeller 26 reduce the twist of the air drawn in to a minimum . behind the guide vanes 28 , in the direction of flow , the rotor head 20 is developed as a radially outwardly - open annular space 30 on the cylindrically developed open outer surface 32 . on surface 32 a connecting ring 36 is mounted via anti - friction bearings 34 for rotation around the axis of the rotor head 20 . four connections 38 ( fig4 ) extend from the connecting ring 36 corresponding to the number of rotor blades 22 , and bear the corresponding rotor blades 22 in the region of their radial outlet openings 40 . in accordance with the invention , each rotor blade 22 is hollow . as shown in fig3 the rotor blade 22 is provided on its trailing edge 42 with outlet slots 44 which are arranged over the length of the blade . from fig2 it can be noted that corresponding deflection ribs 46 lead to the outlet slots 44 , the ribs being developed in the rotor blade 22 and their length increasing towards the tip 48 of the rotor blade 22 . in this way , part of the air drawn in which flows into the hollow rotor blade 22 is conducted in the region of the first deflection rib 46 to the corresponding outlet slot 44 while a part corresponding to the projection of the following deflection rib 46 is deflected to the next outlet slot 44 , and so on . the residual air flow arriving at the tip 48 of the rotor blade 22 passes outward here via the last outlet slot 44 . the air emerging with high kinetic energy at the trailing edge places the rotor blades 22 in rotation and , at the same time , acts as extension of the blade profile ( see fig2 ), as a result of which its lift is again increased . only the rotor blades 22 and the connecting ring ( fig4 ) participate in the rotation of the rotor 14 which has been described , while the rotor head 20 itself is stationary . only the impeller 26 turns within it . the attachment of the rotor blades 22 to the connection 38 of the connecting ring 36 is effected via flapping hinges and / or drag hinges ( not shown ) so that the rotor blades 22 can tilt in known manner around a horizontal axis while the flapping hinges permit periodic displacement of the rotor blades 22 for change in the angle of attack , for instance via cams or a swashplate . for the rotary drive of the impeller 26 an internal combustion engine 50 ( fig5 ) is provided , developed as a radial engine in the embodiment shown . it is arranged in the annular space 30 of the rotor 14 in fixed position below the guide vanes 28 . its vertical drive shaft ( not shown ) is connected to the impeller 26 . the arrangement of the engine 50 in the annular space 30 has the twofold advantage that the passing air drawn in by the impeller 26 both cools the engine 50 and sees to the charging thereof , so that the engine requires neither expensive cooling nor a compressor . the exhaust gases of the engine 50 , moreover flow into the hollow rotor blades 22 where they produce additional pressure and at the same time prevent icing of the rotor blades 22 . fig5 and 6 indicate that the entire rotor head 20 borne by a mounting plate 52 can be displaced in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the fuselage 12 ( double arrow a ). in this way , the pilot can adapt the position of the rotor 14 to the center of gravity of the helicopter 10 . in fig6 which shows a more detailed view as compared with fig5 it can furthermore be noted that the rotor 14 is not rigidly connected to the mounting plate 52 mounted on the fuselage 12 , but is swingable around two horizontal axes which extend at a right angle to each other . for this purpose , a pivot bearing 54 is provided , the outer shell 56 of which is fastened on the mounting plate 52 and the inner shell 58 on the bottom of the rotor head 20 . two pins 60 protrude from the inner shell 58 , said pins lying in two vertical planes forming a right angle with each other and each engaging in a corresponding groove 62 which is provided in the inner side of the outer shell 56 and lies in a corresponding vertical plane . with this development , the rotor head 20 can be swung within the two vertical planes without turning around its yaw axis . by means of the pivot bearing 54 , the pilot can swing the rotor 14 and thus the plane of the rotor blades in , for instance , a forward direction so that the lift is given a horizontal component which causes the advance of the helicopter . in this solution , periodic displacements of the rotor blades 22 around their drag joints is not necessary . as shown in fig1 the rudder 18 of the rotary wing aircraft 10 is pivoted via an oblique pivot shaft 64 to the tail 16 . fig1 shows that the rudder 18 can furthermore be pivoted in combined fashion , for which it has an additional vertical axis of swing 66 . when the rudder 18 , which has been swung around its oblique pivot axis 64 , is blown against in a downward direction , the fuselage 12 effects in a hovering state a rotation around the yaw axis . fig7 shows diagrammatically a variant with which the same effect can be obtained . in this case , two connecting conduits 68 to the tail 16 extend within the fuselage 12 from the annular space 30 of the rotor head 20 , each of said conduits debouching into a corresponding obliquely outwardly - directed control nozzle 70 . by the action of pressure on the corresponding control nozzle 70 , rotation of the fuselage 12 around the yaw axis can be introduced . in the embodiment of fig8 and 9 , the engine 50 , for instance a diesel engine or gas turbine , is arranged in the fuselage 12 of the rotary wing aircraft 10 and connected via bevel gear 72 and a universal shaft 74 to the drive shaft 76 of the axially traversed impeller 26 . behind the stationary guide vanes 28 as seen in the direction flow , ( fig9 ) a radially traversed compressor wheel 78 is fastened on the drive shaft 76 , its pressure side debouching into the annular space 30 which extends into the connecting ring 36 bearing the hollow rotor blades 22 . the connecting ring 36 is supported by the anti - friction bearings 34 in the upper part of the rotor head 20 on the drive shaft 76 and in the lower part on the outer shell 56 of the pivot bearing 54 . since the engine 50 is not arranged in the rotor head 20 in this embodiment , the anti - friction bearings 34 can have a substantially smaller diameter than in the example of fig5 . the connecting ring 36 of the rotor head 20 turns , in this connection , together with the rotor blades 22 with a speed that is substantially less than that of the drive shaft 76 . the invention provides a rotary wing aircraft having a very favorable ratio of dead weight to take - off mass ; this ratio is about 40 %. the machine can be flown in a simple manner and can be manufactured at a favorable price . it has very large drive power . due to its few moving parts , maintenance is simple and inexpensive . because of its simple construction , it is of low net weight . thus , a relatively large blade weight can be realized , as a result of which , on one hand , the dynamic stability is favorable and , on the other hand , the instability of hovering flight is greatly reduced as a result of good damping . furthermore , due to the storing of a large amount of rotational energy , there is the advantage that , in the event of failure of the engine , effective pullout maneuvers can be carried out by increasing the blade angle of attack . the blade angle of attack can be maintained at about 4 Â°, thus obtaining the structural advantage that a shift to autogyro operation can be dispensed with . the non - rotating development of the rotor head 20 provides the possibility of arranging on its top a platform which provides protection in the case of military use and can serve as support for a weapon . it should be understood that the preferred embodiments and examples described are for illustrative purposes only and are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the present invention which is properly delineated only in the appended claims .
