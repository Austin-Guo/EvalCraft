now referring to fig1 the offset of the center of gravity s from the vehicle center is referred to as s y , the level of the center of gravity above the roadway is designated by the letter h . to determine the sums of tire contact forces f lz and f rz and the sum of transverse force f y , the vehicle is looked at as a rigid body in a simplified two - dimensional model , onto which body only the contact forces between tire contact area and roadway act beside the gravitational force . aerodynamic forces and the movement of vehicle parts relative to a system of coordinates ( x , y , z ) on the vehicle moved along with the vehicle body , such as the rotation and compression of the vehicle wheels , may be ignored in this context . a rigid body moves under the effect of applied forces and torques according to generally known mathematical interrelationships , i . e . center - of - mass law and an extended form of the euler equations for the angular motion of especially rigid bodies giving the spatial angular momentum vector equation . after having detected the state of motion of the rigid body , it is possible to use these motion equations to make conclusions with respect to the acting forces and torques . the right - hand and left - hand sums of tire contact forces f lz , f rz sought are computed from the vehicle &# 39 ; s state of motion . it shows in a simplified modeling of the vehicle that is reduced to the plane normal to vehicle &# 39 ; s longitudinal direction that the vertical acceleration u z and transverse acceleration u y , as well as the roll angle velocity φ and roll angle acceleration φ are sufficient as measuring signals to determine the left - hand and right - hand tire contact forces sought . additionally , the sum f y of the transverse forces exerted by the roadway to the tires is achieved . the state of motion in the system on the vehicle is measured . to this end , the sensors should be fixed to the vehicle , meaning , they should not be kept in a spatial alignment , constant in time , by means of a gyro - stabilized platform . instead of the mentioned sensor signals , any other sensor configuration may , of course , be chosen , from the signals of which the above - mentioned signals can be computed . in particular , the measuring point and the alignment of the sensors may be chosen relatively freely , they only need to be on the vehicle and sense motions in all directions necessary for computation . it is also possible to use further acceleration sensors instead of the angular velocity sensors . in this case , however , the sensors must be distributed onto at least two measuring points on the vehicle that are placed as far as possible in their projection to the modeling plane . what is taken into account in the calculation of the forces from the sensor signals for judging the imminent risk of rollover is , on the one hand , the geometry of the sensor assembly which is defined by the position of the sensors in the vehicle and , on the other hand , wheelbase and track b which can also be assumed as being known , and finally the mass parameters of the vehicle composed of total mass m , position of the center of gravity s , and mass inertia tensor { umlaut over ( θ )} a . the mass parameters can change only slowly , compared to the variables of the system under review such as sensor data and forces , apart from abrupt changes , such as load slipping to one side . therefore , they are first not known , yet accessible to an identification for which forces are also required apart from the acceleration data anyway available . in contrast to the above noted highly dynamic force measuring signals , however , assessed values are sufficient for this identification , which can be determined from the compression travels during quasi - stationary motional phases of the vehicle . the mass as a parameter may be obviated when the forces are e . g . normalized to the weight of the vehicle . the vehicle mass m is thereby omitted in the equations , and mass geometry is taken into consideration in the system of coordinates of the vehicle only in the form of center - of - gravity position , inertia radii and the position of the inertia ellipsoid . of course , it is not possible to calculate each individual force that acts on the body by means of the method described hereinabove because forces that are applied along the same line of application will appear only as a sum in motion equations and , consequently , only their sum can be determined . thus , it is impossible to conclude the individual transverse forces at the left and right front wheel from a sum of the transverse forces determined for the front wheels by way of the vehicle &# 39 ; s state of motion . in the two - dimensional modeling of the vehicle that will be described in the following , the disclosed method allows the highly dynamic determination of the left - hand and right - hand sums of tire contact forces and the sum of the transverse forces with respect to the vehicle . this feature also permits the time extrapolation of the determined force signals and the forecast of the time when a vehicle side will lift . the knowledge of the motion equations and the state of motion of the vehicle model enables in addition optimal control interventions for avoiding rollover in the way of braking and steering interventions . other acceleration signals and a pitching and yaw rate signal may be used in a completely spatial modeling of the vehicle . [ 0028 ] fig1 shows the simplified two - dimensional model of the vehicle for determining the tire contact forces and the transverse force in the y - z plane . the following approach may be taken to derive the computation guide of the invention : m ( { right arrow over ( a )}+{ right arrow over ( s )} { umlaut over ())}={ right arrow over ( f )} ( 3 ) spatial angular momentum vector equation ( generalized form of the euler equations ) { right arrow over ( s )}= { right arrow over ( s )}, { right arrow over ({ umlaut over ( s )})} =( + 2 ) { right arrow over ( s )} ( 5 ) { right arrow over ( s )}= 0 { right arrow over ( e )} x + s y { right arrow over ( e )} y + s z { right arrow over ( e )} z ( 6 ) { right arrow over ( ω )}={ dot over ( φ )} { right arrow over ( e )} x + 0 { right arrow over ( e )} y + 0 { right arrow over ( e )} z ( 7 ) { right arrow over ({ umlaut over ( s )})}={ umlaut over ( φ )}{ right arrow over ( e )} x ×( s y { right arrow over ( e )} y + s z { right arrow over ( e )} z )+{ dot over ( φ )} 2 { right arrow over ( e )} x ×({ right arrow over ( e )} x ×( s y y + s z { right arrow over ( e )} z )) { right arrow over ({ umlaut over ( s )})} ={ umlaut over ( φ )}( s y { right arrow over ( e )} z − s z { right arrow over ( e )} y )+{ dot over ( φ )} 2 (− s y { right arrow over ( e )} y − s z { right arrow over ( e )} z ) { right arrow over ({ umlaut over ( s )})} =(−{ umlaut over ( φ )} s z −{ dot over ( φ )} 2 s y ) ë y +({ umlaut over ( φ )} s y −{ dot over ( φ )} 2 s z ){ right arrow over ( e )} z ( 8 ) & amp ;
