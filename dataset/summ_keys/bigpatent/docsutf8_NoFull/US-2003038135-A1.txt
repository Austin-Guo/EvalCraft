[ 0024 ] fig1 illustrates one exemplary embodiment of a container of the present invention , which is generally referred to as 10 . the container 10 may include a plurality of support members such as loop segments 12 circumferentially disposed around a base member such as a circular rim 14 . each loop segment 12 may include a first distal end 13 and a second distal end 15 , as more clearly shown in fig2 . each distal end 13 and 15 may be rotatably connected with a rim 14 by any conventional means such as an eyelet formed in each end as an integral part of a loop segment 12 or other appropriate means . the loop segments 12 may be disposed around rim 14 so that the first distal end 13 of one loop segment 12 overlaps the second distal end 15 of the adjacent loop segment 12 immediately next to it . alternatively , the distal ends 13 and 15 of adjacent loop segments 12 may abut one another rather than overlap . a plurality of stoppers 17 may be disposed on the circumference of rim 14 to prevent movement of the distal ends of the loop segments 12 outside a predetermined distance on the rim 14 . stoppers 17 may be round metal knobs affixed to the rim 14 by any conventional means such as spot welding or soldering , for example . [ 0025 ] fig1 also illustrates load - bearing means 16 , which may be rigidly affixed by any conventional means , such as spot welding or soldering , to one or more loop segments 12 . in one exemplary embodiment , load - bearing means 16 are affixed to alternating loop segments 12 and are adapted to receive a portion of an adjacent loop segment 12 when all loop segments 12 are moved to an extended or usable configuration . in its extended configuration the interior of container 10 defines a volume within which an object may be placed , as best shown in fig6 . load - bearing means 16 may be affixed near a curvilinear portion 18 of loop segment 12 or they may be affixed to other portions of loop segment 12 to accommodate for adjustments to the size or shape of container 10 . additionally , when affixed to loop segment 12 , load - bearing means 16 may define a plane that is oblique to or offset from a plane defined by loop segment 12 . the load - bearing means 16 may define an opening 20 for receiving a portion of an adjacent loop segment 12 when the container 10 is in its usable configuration , as best shown in fig6 . as can be appreciated from fig1 and 6 , container 10 may be transformed from a substantially planar configuration to an extended configuration for holding an object . in the extended position , the support members , such as loop segments 12 , of the container 10 define a substantially hemispherical volume within which a potted plant or other objects may be placed . load - bearing means 16 may be configured substantially as a hook as shown in fig1 which may include a first leg 22 extending substantially perpendicular from loop segment 12 and a second leg 24 extending at a substantially right angle from first leg 22 . this configuration may define an opening 20 between second leg 24 and the loop segment 12 . load - bearing means 16 may be formed by alternate configurations such as an arcuate or hook shaped wire , or a straight wire segment , for example , extending from loop segment 12 . in one exemplary embodiment , first leg 22 and second leg 24 receive a portion of an adjacent loop segment 12 when the container 10 is in its extended or usable position , as shown in fig6 . in this manner , a portion of the adjacent loop segment 12 may impinge upon the first leg 22 and / or the second leg 24 either under its own weight or when an additional force is exerted on the loop segments 12 when an object is placed within container 10 . a portion of any adjacent loop segment may also impinge on a portion of the adjacent loop segment to which the load - bearing means is affixed when the container 10 is in its extended position . [ 0028 ] fig3 and 4 illustrate another exemplary embodiment of a container of the present invention , which is generally referred to as 30 . container 30 may include a plurality of support members such as the depending support member rods 32 . rods 32 may rotatably engage a first brace 34 by any conventional means such as an eyelet formed in a proximal end 36 of rod 32 . rods 32 may be curvilinear to define a volume for accepting an object of similar shape or they may be substantially liner or have right angles to form a rectangular volume , for example . load - bearing means may be formed in the distal end 38 of rod 32 such as a hook 40 , which may be formed as an integral part of rod 32 , or affixed thereto by conventional means . alternately , load - bearing means may comprise a clamp , latching mechanism or other suitable configurations . hook 40 may be releasably inserted into a corresponding aperture 42 formed within a corresponding tab 44 . tab 44 may extend substantially horizontally from a base 46 . hook 40 bears the load exerted by rod 32 under its own weight and additional load exerted on the container 30 when an object is placed therein . in one exemplary embodiment , three rods 32 rotatably depend from a first brace 34 with hooks 40 being releasably inserted into corresponding apertures 42 formed in corresponding tabs 44 . load - bearing means such as a catch 48 may be provided on one or more of the rods 32 for receiving a support member such as a second brace 50 . the first brace 34 and second brace 50 may rotatably engage a base member such as a substantially planar back plate 46 . back plate 46 may be formed of intersecting metal strips , for example , or it may be other configurations such as a solid piece of lightweight metal . first brace 34 and second brace 50 may rotatably engage back plate 46 by any conventional means , such as a hook and eyelet , so that they may be articulated between a collapsed position and an extended or usable position . in the extended position shown in fig4 the catch 48 may define an open end 52 for receiving the second brace 50 . the catch 48 bears the load exerted by the second brace 50 under its own weight and an additional load exerted by the container 30 when an object is placed therein . [ 0029 ] fig5 illustrates another exemplary embodiment of a container of the present invention , which is generally referred to as 60 . container 60 may include supporting members such as side frames 62 and end frames 64 . side frames 62 and end frames 64 may rotatably engage a base member such as the substantially planar frame 65 by any conventional means . for example , hooks 66 may be formed in the side and end frames and be secured over a portion of the planar frame 65 so that the frames 62 and 64 may be articulated between a collapsed position and an extended or usable position . container 60 is substantially planar when in the collapsed position . load - bearing means such as hooks 68 may be disposed near the top portion of end frames 64 so they releasably engage a portion of the side frames 62 when container 60 is in its extended position . hooks 66 bear the load exerted by end frames 64 under their own weight and additional load when container 60 contains an object . while the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described herein , it will be obvious that such embodiments are provided by way of example only . numerous variations , changes and substitutions will occur to those of skill in the art without departing from the invention herein . accordingly , it is intended that the invention be limited only by the spirit and scope of the appended claims .
