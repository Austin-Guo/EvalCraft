fig1 illustrates a first apparatus 1 according to the invention for cleaning a jet engine 50 . the jet engine 50 is an engine with turbofan 51 and is illustrated as such diagrammatically . the engine 50 has , in addition to the turbofan 51 , also a plurality of compressor stages 52 , a combustion chamber 53 and turbine stages 54 . moreover , a shaft hub 55 is provided which is connected fixedly in terms of rotation to a turbofan . part of the airstream , which passes through the turbofan 51 when the engine 50 is in operation , passes into the compressor stages 52 and subsequently into the combustion chamber 53 and the turbine stages 54 ; another part is conducted past these components in a secondary stream duct 56 . the apparatus 1 according to the invention consists of a supply device 2 comprising a tank for the cleaning medium which is suitable for storing liquid carbon dioxide , of a cooling device for cooling this tank and a pump . by means of the pump , the cleaning medium can be pumped through a line connection 3 to the nozzle device 4 . the nozzle device 4 has two nozzles 5 through which the cleaning agent can emerge . the cleaning agent used is liquid carbon dioxide in which flakes are formed shortly after it emerges from the nozzles . these flakes pass into the engine and because of their low temperature release the dirt from the components of the engine as a result of induced cold / heat stresses . the engine may in this case rotate in the dry cranking mode . owing to the airstream thereby occurring , the carbon dioxide flakes are distributed in the entire engine . moreover , the released dirt can thus be blown out of the engine to the rear and captured there . since the solid carbon dioxide is completely sublimated after some time , no residues remain behind in the engine . the released dirt also no longer has to be separated from the cleaning medium , but can be disposed of immediately . the nozzles 5 of the nozzle device 4 may be oriented such that the solid carbon dioxide passes mainly into the compressor stages 52 and not into the secondary stream duct 56 . fig2 shows a second apparatus according to the invention for cleaning a jet engine 50 . here , the nozzle device 4 is fastened directly to the engine 50 . it is supplied with the cleaning medium via the line 3 by the supply device , not illustrated . the cleaning medium employed here is carbon dioxide pellets which are kept in stock in the supply device , not illustrated , and are sprayed out of the nozzles 5 of the nozzle device 4 with the aid of a propellant gas . the apparatus from fig2 is otherwise identical to the apparatus from fig1 , and therefore reference is made to the statements given above . the apparatus for cleaning a jet engine 50 in fig3 has a nozzle device 4 which is connected fixedly in terms of rotation to the shaft hub 55 of the turbofan 51 . the nozzle device 4 is supplied with carbon dioxide as the cleaning medium via the line 3 from the supply device , not illustrated . the nozzle device 4 is explained in more detail with reference to the following figures . the nozzle device in fig4 has two ring elements 101 , 102 , with the aid of which the nozzle device is attached onto a shaft hub 55 of the turbofan 51 of a jet engine 50 ( see fig3 , 5 and 6 ). in the attached state , the ring elements 101 , 102 surround the shaft hub 55 essentially positively . the two ring elements 101 , 102 are connected to one another by means of radial struts 104 . arranged at the upstream tip of the nozzle device ( with respect to the direction of flow of the engine ) is arranged a rotary coupling , designated as a whole by 105 . from this rotary coupling 105 extend two delivery lines 106 which lead radially outward and which feed two flat - jet nozzles 107 with cleaning medium . in the view of fig7 showing a detail , it can be seen that the two delivery lines 106 are liquid - connected via radial ducts 108 and an axial duct 109 of the rotary coupling 105 to a feed line 3 which connects the rotary coupling 105 to the supply unit , not illustrated in the drawing . the delivery lines 106 are fixed at the intersection points with the ring elements 101 , 102 to these ring elements and are therefore part of the carrying structure of the overall nozzle device 4 . for fastening the nozzle device 4 to the shaft hub 55 of the turbofan 51 , guy ropes , indicated at 111 , are provided , which are hooked on the trailing edges of the turbofan blades by means of the hooks 112 . as can be seen in fig8 , the guy ropes 111 are led , via guy rope guides 117 fastened to the rotary coupling , to the rotary coupling and are fastened there to an axially displaceable tension ring 113 . compression springs 114 are supported on an annular shoulder 115 of the rotary coupling and exert on the tension ring 113 a force acting in the direction away from the annular shoulder 115 . in the attached state , the compression springs 114 exert a prestress on the guy ropes 111 and consequently ensure that the nozzle device is fixed to the hub 55 of the turbofan 51 . the tension ring 113 is moved upstream by means of a tension nut 116 which is seated on a thread of the coupling housing 118 . as a result , a tension force is transmitted to the guy ropes 111 , and therefore a secure connection of the nozzle device to the hub of the fan is made . for cleaning the compressor stages 52 , the combustion chamber 53 and the turbine stages 54 of a jet engine 50 with a turbofan 51 , the nozzle device 4 is attached onto the shaft hub 55 of the turbofan 51 in the way which can be seen particularly from fig5 and 6 and is fixed to the blades of the turbofan 51 by means of the hooks 112 . the engine is set in rotation ( dry cranking ). the flat - jet nozzles 107 are fed with cleaning medium from the supply device , not illustrated , via the connecting line 3 , the rotary coupling 105 and the delivery lines 106 . this cleaning medium sweeps the inlet of the first compressor stage over its entire circumference and thus carries out the cleaning .
