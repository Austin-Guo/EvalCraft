the disclosure of u . s . provisional patent application no . 61 / 157 , 616 filed mar . 5 , 2009 entitled tape systems for refacing racks , shelves , labeling surfaces and the like is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety . fig1 and 2 depict two illustrative embodiments of multi - layer tapes 100 and 200 , respectively , in accordance with the present application . fig3 depicts a detailed view of the multiple layers included in each of the tapes 100 and 200 . as shown in fig3 , the multiple layers of each tape 100 , 200 include an adhesive coating 312 , a masking layer or film 310 with an optional printable surface 308 , and a release topcoat 302 such as a silicone release topcoat for supporting replaceable adhesive - backed pressure sensitive labels ( e . g ., label 404 ; see fig4 b ). more specifically , the masking layer or film can include the base masking film 310 ( typically silver ), the printable surface 308 ( typically white ) on one face of the base masking film 310 , and the adhesive coating 312 on the opposite face of the base masking film 310 . for example , the base masking film 310 may be a silver polyester film , a metalized masking film , a metalized biaxially - oriented polypropylene ( bopp ) film , or any other suitable opaque masking film . in one embodiment , the printable surface 308 , the base masking film 310 , and the adhesive coating 312 are implemented using a metalized bopp film having a print - receptive topcoat and a metalized backside . the adhesive coating 312 of the tape 200 ( see fig2 ) can be affixed to an optional release - coated liner 314 , which can include a silicone release layer . in one embodiment , the adhesive coating 312 comprises a black adhesive that can also serve as a masking feature . the tape 100 of fig1 is of the “ self - wound ” type that does not require the release - coated liner 314 . as shown in fig3 , the multiple layers of the tapes 100 , 200 can further include a transparent laminating film 304 with an adhesive coating 306 on one face thereof and the silicone release topcoat 302 on the opposite face thereof . it is noted that the printable surface 308 may be any desired color and / or printed with a trademark ( s ), instructions , a logo ( s ), or any other suitable information , which can be viewed through the transparent laminating film 304 . the adhesive face 306 of the laminating film 304 is adhered to a non - adhesive face of the printable surface 308 . the tape 100 without the release liner 314 is typically self - wound on a roll , as illustrated in fig1 . the tape 200 can be die cut , as illustrated in fig2 , to remove marginal portions of the layers 302 , 304 , 306 , 308 , 310 , and 312 . as a result , the release liner 314 is made larger than the tape 200 to facilitate its removal . an illustrative method of using the presently disclosed tape for refacing or resurfacing rack beams , shelves , or any other suitable object or article is described below with reference to fig1 , 2 , 3 , 4 a , 4 b , and 6 . when using the die - cut tape 200 ( see fig2 ), the first step is to remove the disposable release - coated liner 314 ( see fig3 ) from the tape 200 , as depicted in step 602 ( see fig6 ). it is noted that step 602 is not required when using the self - wound tape 100 ( see fig1 ). the tape 100 ( or 200 ) can then be applied to a rack beam 402 ( see fig4 a and 4 b ) such that the adhesive 312 secures the tape 100 ( or 200 ) firmly along the length of the beam surface ( see fig4 b ) with the release topcoat 302 outermost and any printing on the printable surface 308 clearly visible , as depicted in step 604 . then , a label 404 ( see fig4 b ), a label holder , or any other suitable item having an exposed adhesive layer is affixed to the tape 100 ( or 200 ) such that the label &# 39 ; s adhesive makes contact with the release topcoat 302 , as depicted in step 606 . for example , the label 404 may carry printed indicia related to the rack location id , products stored , pricing , safety , or any other suitable information . when desired , such as when changing location specifications , the label 404 can be removed from the release topcoat 302 and a new label can be affixed to the tape 100 ( or 200 ) on the rack beam 402 , as depicted in step 608 . it is further noted that when the tape 100 ( or 200 ) is applied to the rack beam 402 , any pits or pockmarks on the beam are securely covered and hidden by the tape , thereby providing a clean , smooth surface upon which any suitable label ( s ) may be affixed . fig5 a depicts a rack beam 502 that has a number of existing bar code labels 504 and other labeling 506 affixed thereto . after the tape 100 ( or 200 ) is applied to the surface of the rack beam 502 , a clean , smooth labeling surface is provided that completely hides the labels 504 , 506 originally affixed to the beam ( see fig5 b ), thereby obviating the need to remove the labels 504 , 506 from the beam . the presently disclosed tape systems 100 , 200 allow pressure sensitive labels to be easily removed and replaced on rack beams , shelves , or any other suitable object , as many times as necessary . such labels can be removed without ripping or tearing . further , new labels can be applied without fear of previous labels or markings affecting the scan of a bar code . this allows rack beams and shelves to remain clean and uniform and contain only labels with the most current required data . as a result , any confusion from numerous labels with conflicting information on the rack beams or shelves is minimized . moreover , the release topcoat 302 of the tapes 100 , 200 allows any commercially available label to be used , including those with inexpensive permanent pressure sensitive adhesive coatings rather than more expensive removable coatings . having described the above illustrative embodiments of the presently disclosed system and method of refacing or resurfacing rack beams , shelves , and other such objects , other alternative embodiments or variations may be made . for example , fig7 a depicts a detailed view of multiple layers included in a first alternative embodiment 700 , which is a transparent version of the tapes 100 and 200 . as shown in fig7 a , the multiple layers of the tape 700 include a transparent laminating film 704 with an adhesive coating 706 on one face thereof , and a silicone release topcoat 702 on the opposite face thereof for supporting replaceable adhesive - backed pressure sensitive labels . the transparent tape 700 can be used to reface or resurface rack beams , shelves , or any other suitable object or article , while allowing labels , label holders , or other such items to be applied to and removed from the release topcoat layer 702 of the tape 700 . fig7 b depicts a detailed view of multiple layers included in a second alternative embodiment 701 , which is a colored version of the tapes 100 and 200 . as shown in fig7 b , the multiple layers of the tape 701 include a transparent lamination layer 707 and a colored layer 713 . the lamination layer 707 includes a transparent laminating film 710 with an adhesive coating 712 on one face thereof , and a silicone release topcoat 708 on the opposite face thereof for supporting replaceable adhesive - backed pressure sensitive labels . the colored layer 713 includes a base colored film layer 714 with an adhesive coating 716 on one face thereof . the face of the base colored film layer 714 opposite the adhesive coating 716 is a non - adhesive face , and the adhesive layer 712 of the lamination layer 707 is applied to the non - adhesive face of the base colored film layer 714 . like the transparent tape 700 , the colored tape 701 can be used to reface or resurface rack beams , shelves , or any other suitable object or article , while allowing labels , label holders , or other such items to be applied to and removed from the release topcoat layer 708 of the tape 701 . moreover , the base colored film layer 714 may be colored to substantially match or contrast with the existing color of the object to which the tape 701 is applied . for example , the base colored film layer 714 can be made using a colored base material , ink covering the base material , thermal - melted ribbon covering the base material , adhesive - backed vinyl covering the base material , a silk screen technique , an ink jet / toner technique , or any other suitable covering , coating , coloring , or printing technique , resulting in a color on the base film layer 714 that can be seen through the transparent lamination layer 707 . it will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that further modifications to and variations of the above - described tape systems for refacing racks , shelves , labeling surfaces and the like may be made without departing from the inventive concepts disclosed herein . accordingly , the invention should not be viewed as limited except as by the scope and spirit of the appended claims .
