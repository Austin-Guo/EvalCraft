the present invention relates to an exercise kit for use indoors to simulate the exercise and develop the muscles used in participation in cross - country skiing outdoors and rowing . the kit also permits other exercises for the arms and legs . the kit comprises a main frame 10 which is the shape of an elongate rectangle having longitudinal side members 11 and 12 , opposite end members 14 and 15 and two members 16 and 18 which extend between the end members parallel to said side members 11 and 12 and parallel to each other to define a pair of rails extending lengthwise of the frame . attached and positioned oblique to the end member 15 is a pair of spaced foot rest pads 20 and 21 . a pulley 22 is pivotally connected to the end member 15 on the side opposite the foot pads 20 and 21 . a spring member 25 is connected at one end to the end member 14 between the two frame members 16 and 18 . the spring member 25 , as illustrated , comprises a plurality of horizontally disposed helical tension springs 26 connected at one end to the end member 14 and to a bracket 27 at their other end . the bracket 27 is connected to one end of a cable 29 which extends through the pulley 22 and about the wheel thereof and through a handle 30 . the cable terminates in an eye 31 . the eye 31 is adapted for connection to a hook 32 on a seat 60 to be hereinafter described . the springs 26 and bracket 27 are supported by a plate 34 positioned at the bottom of the frame between frame members 16 and 18 . the side members 11 and 12 and the frame members 16 and 18 define parallel rails to support a pair of roller members 35 . the roller members 35 comprise an inverted channel shaped frame 36 of rectangular appearance . the upper surface 37 of the frame 36 supports a pad 38 of upholstored foam having a fabric or vinyl covering . the depending flanges 39 of the frame 36 support a pair of transversely extending parallel shafts 40 on each of which is supported rotatably a pair of axially spaced rollers 42 . the rollers 42 comprise a cylindrical member of metal having radially projecting flanges which guide the rollers 42 and roller members 35 along the rails as shown in fig2 . brake means are formed between the roller members 35 and the frame 10 to restrict free , unrestrained rolling movement of said roller members 35 . as shown in fig2 and 5 , the brake means comprise a narrow longitudinal rib 45 extending the length of the rail and between and parallel to the side members 11 and 12 and the frame members 16 and 18 . a threaded rod 46 extends through the flanges 39 of the frame 36 and has a lock nut 47 to restrict displacement of the same . a knurled handle 48 is fixed on the other end . positioned along the rod 46 is a pair of rectangular plates 49 and 50 , each having a friction covering 51 on the opposed faces to engage the rib 45 . one plate 50 is fixed to a threaded nut 52 and moves along the rod upon rotation thereof , and the other plate 49 is urged against the rib 45 by a compression spring 53 . rotation of the knurled handle 48 will loosen the frictional force of the plates 50 against the rib 45 or increase the frictional force to control the freedom of movement of the roller members 35 along the rails . plate 49 is urged against rib 45 continuously . a seat 60 comprising a padded rectangular surface 61 and back support 62 is shown in fig2 and 4 . the seat is adapted to straddle both of the roller members 35 and to move in unison with the roller members to and fro along the rails . the seat 60 is provided with a hook 32 near the front edge of the seat 60 for attachment to the eye 31 on the cable 29 . an arm 71 is pivotally connected to each side member 11 and 12 of the frame 10 . the arms 71 have a generally circular disc 72 at one end with a central pin receiving opening . the other end terminates in a hand grip 74 . the arms include a tubular rod 75 connected to the disc 72 and the hand grip 74 fits over the opposite end of the rod . the arm 71 is between about 48 and 54 inches long . the disc 72 is provided with a friction covering 77 on each side . the covered disc is positioned between a fixed first plate 78 having an l - shape in end view with the foot of the l fixed to the side members 11 and 12 . a second plate 79 of similar shape is provided with a surface to rest on the foot of plate 78 . a threaded bolt 81 extends through plate 79 , disc 72 and plate 78 . a threaded handle 80 receives the bolt 81 and as it is threaded on the bolt , the pressure of the plates 78 and 79 against the disc 72 increases to increase the resistance to rotation of the arm 71 about the bolt 81 in relationship to the frame 10 . in use , as a cross - country skiing exerciser , the seat 60 is removed from the roller members 35 . the arms 71 are raised off a pair of rests on brackets not shown on side members 11 and 12 . the handles 80 are adjusted to provide the tension or resistance desired for pivoting the arms . similarily , the resistance to movement for the roller members 35 is adjusted by turning handles 48 . the feet are placed on the roller members 35 and the hands grasp the hand grips 74 of the arms 71 . exercise begins by sliding the roller members 35 to and fro , along the rails and simultaneously swinging the arms 71 in the manner of alternately sliding the skis and moving the poles . to perform the rowing exercise , the handles 80 are loosened and the arms 71 are positioned parallel to the frame . the roller members are aligned on the rails and the seat is returned to a position across both roller members . by sitting on the seat and placing the feet on the rest pads 20 and 21 , the position is assumed and the exercise begins by grasping the handle 30 with the palms of the hands down and drawing the handle toward the body while simultaneously pushing the seat away from the foot rest pads 20 and 21 by straightening the legs . as the tension in the springs is released slowly the legs are bent , bringing the seat and roller members forward . a leg press exercise is performed by drawing the seat 60 and roller members toward the foot rests 20 and 21 and connecting the eye 31 of the cable to the hook 32 at the front of the seat . by straightening and bending the legs under the tension of the springs 26 , the seat is moved back and forth , along with the roller members 35 along the rails . by releasing the eye 31 from the hook 32 on the seat 60 and grasping the handle 30 with both hands , having the palms up , the arms may be bent toward the chin , tensioning the springs 26 and exercising the arms . having thus described the present invention with reference to a preferred embodiment , it will be appreciated that modifications can be made without departing from the scope or spirit of the present invention as defined by the appended claims .
