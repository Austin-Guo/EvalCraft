100 comprising at least one connecting structure 102 ( one shown ). closure device 100 can further comprise one or more base structures , for example , a first base portion 104 and a second base portion 106 , as shown in fig1 . closure device 100 is shown configured with a container 108 ( in this case a bag ). the opening 110 of container 108 can be at least partially covered by connecting structure 102 and can be held shut by closure device 100 , as opening 110 is between a first portion 112 of connecting structure 102 and a second portion 114 of connecting structure 102 , such that container 108 is held closed . as shown in fig1 , the connecting structure 102 can be configured to connect said first base portion 104 and said second base portion 104 . each of first portion 112 and second portion 114 can be connected to container 108 in one or more of the following ways : 1 ) connected to different sides of container 108 , such that opening 110 is held at least partially shut ( for example opposing sides of container 108 as shown ); 2 ) directly connected to different sides of container 108 , such that opening 110 is held at least partially shut , for example , in embodiments where closure device 100 does not comprise a base structure ; 3 ) connected to one or more base structures , which are in turn connected to different sides of container 108 , such that opening 110 is held at least partially shut ; 4 ) connected to container 108 at different sides , such that first portion 112 and second portion 114 are held in place and / or connected to the sides of the container by one or more base structures , such that opening 110 is held at least partially shut ( for example , by being sandwiched between a base structure and a side of the container ); and / or 5 ) any connection configuration that is known in the art . closure device 100 , including connecting structure 102 and base structures 104 , 106 can be made from any suitable material that could provide enough support to allow closure device 100 to hold container 108 closed . some example materials include , but are not limited to : paper , resin , rubber , vinyl , polyurethane , poly vinyl chloride ( pvc ), polystyrene foam , polymers / copolymer substances , acrylic substances , plastic , leather , metal , glass , fiberglass , wood , cloth or a combination thereof . the closure device 100 can be formed by any suitable method known in the art , for example , paper folding , molding , injection molding , stamping and extrusion . if the material chosen for closure device 100 is sturdy enough and the connection to container 108 is freely removable without causing significant damage to container 108 and / or closure device 100 , then closure device 100 can be reusable . in some embodiments , closure device 100 comprises one or more materials that can be easily destroyed by intentional manual manipulation , for example , paper which one can rip or tear . in these embodiments , closure device 100 can transform a common conventional container , such as a bag , into a wrapped gift , wherein one can destroy a portion of connecting structure 102 to allow access to a gift contained within the container 108 . while connecting structure 102 and base structures 104 , 106 are shown in fig1 as being roughly linear / rectangular and trapezoidal respectively , it is understood that these features can comprise any known shape , including any regular or irregular polygon . further novel shapes , for example , in the gift bag embodiments are discussed further below in regard to fig4 . one or more portions of connecting structure 102 and / or one or more portions of base structures 104 , 106 can be connected to container 108 in a variety of ways by various connection element including , but not limited to : suction cups , hooks , gripping mechanisms , hook and loop connections ( such as velcro ®), male / female connections , adhesives , tapes and any connection configuration known in the art . fig2 shows one such example of one connection configuration . fig2 shows a closure device 200 , similar to closure device 100 , comprising a connecting structure 202 , a first base structure 204 and a second base structure 206 . both first base structure 204 and second base structure 206 are angled in fig2 , such that the sides that are to be facing the container to be closed are exposed to view . first and second base structures 204 , 206 are shown comprising first and second adhesive structures 208 , 210 respectively , which are configured to connect to a portion of a container that is to be closed . in the embodiment shown , adhesive structures 208 , 210 comprise separate adhesive pads connected to base structures 204 , 206 which are coated with an adhesive material , such that they can stick to a portion of a container , as discussed above with reference to fig1 . in some embodiments , a film 211 covers the adhesive surface of one or more of the adhesive structures 208 , 210 , which blocks access to the adhesive surface and can be removed by , for example , peeling the film off to expose the adhesive surface when closure device 200 is ready to use . closure device 200 can be manufactured and distributed as a single attached unit or in multiple parts as separate components , for example , as three separate parts ( e . g . a connecting structure , a first base structure and a second base structure ) or two separate parts ( e . g . a connecting structure connected to a first base structure and a separate second base structure , as shown in fig2 ). one advantage of manufacturing closure device 200 as multiple structures is that the length and looseness of connecting structure 202 can be more precisely controlled . for example , the effective length of the connecting structure 202 can be shortened when closure device 200 is used on a container . in some embodiments , the above - mentioned shortening of the effective length of connecting structure 202 can be accomplished by connecting first base structure 204 to one side of a container , wrapping a desired length of connecting structure 202 over the opening of the container , and then pinning a portion of connecting structure 202 to the opposing side of the container utilizing second base structure 206 . depending on how long or short one wants connecting structure 202 to effectively be , one can connect second base structure 206 to a variable portion of the length of connecting structure 202 on the side of a container opposing the side of the container to which first base structure 204 is connected . in some embodiments , one of more of base structures 204 , 206 can comprise a holding portion 212 , which can be used to better contain any excess length of connecting structure 202 . examples of such holding structures include small folds , recesses , handles or spools that can store excess length . in some embodiments , wherein connecting structure 202 is made of a flexible material , such as paper , the excess length can be easily handled by simply folding or bending connecting structure 202 prior to using base structure 206 to connect connecting structure 202 to the opposing side of the container . the above mentioned adjustable length feature is shown in more detail in fig3 , which shows a closure device 300 , similar to closure device 200 discussed in fig2 above . closure device 300 comprises a connecting structure 302 , a first base structure 304 and a second base structure 306 . like in fig2 , first base structure 304 and the connecting structure 302 are connected , while second base structure 306 is a separate structure . second base structure 306 pins connecting structure 302 to the side 308 of container 310 , which opposes the side 312 to which first base structure 304 is connected . the location along the length of connecting structure 302 , which second base structure 306 pins to opposing side 308 results in connecting structure 302 having a fairly long - length and slack state of looseness . this allows for a wider opening 314 for container 310 . this is useful if container 310 is larger or is containing a larger number of items within it . to adjust the length of connecting structure 302 such that the container 310 is more tightly closed and more closely resembles container 108 in fig1 , one would simply connect second base structure 306 to a higher point 316 on connecting structure 302 and pin connecting structure 302 to opposing side 308 at the higher point 316 . the additional length of connecting structure 302 that is below higher point 316 could be folded , bent , obscured by base structure 306 , or stored in a holding portion as discussed above . fig4 shows a closure device 400 , similar to the closure devices 100 , 200 , 300 already discussed herein with reference to fig1 - 3 . closure device 400 differs in that it comprises a first base structure 402 and a second base structure 404 , which comprise festive shapes . this is particularly useful in embodiments wherein closure device 400 is utilized as a gift bag . for example , the base structures 402 , 404 could be shaped like birthday cakes for a birthday gift bag , buckets of golf balls for a retirement party or sheriff &# 39 ; s badges for a policeman &# 39 ; s anniversary . any number of festive shapes can be implemented for any number of occasions . in some embodiments , the base structures 402 , 404 , which can include festive shapes , can hide or mask all or some of a portion of the container , for example , the side to which the base structure 402 , 404 is connected . in these embodiments , the overall look or appearance of a container , for example , a common brown bag , can be concealed to appear to be a gift bag , for example , by having the shape , size or dimensions of the base structures 420 , 404 match or otherwise correspond to the dimensions of the side of the bag to which the base structures 402 , 404 are connected . in this way , closure devices incorporating features of the present invention can simultaneously at least partially close a container and at least partially conceal a container &# 39 ; s appearance . in some embodiments , the base structures 402 , 404 are configured to conceal a substantial portion of the sides of the container to which they are connected . although the present invention has been described in detail with reference to certain preferred configurations thereof , other versions are possible . embodiments of the present invention can comprise any combination of compatible features shown in the various figures , and these embodiments should not be limited to those expressly illustrated and discussed . therefore , the spirit and scope of the invention should not be limited to the versions described above . the foregoing is intended to cover all modifications and alternative constructions falling within the spirit and scope of the invention .
