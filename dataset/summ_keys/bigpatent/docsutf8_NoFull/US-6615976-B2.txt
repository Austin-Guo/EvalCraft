referring to fig1 a prior art stone slinger truck is generally shown at 10 . the truck includes an endless thrower belt 12 , that is attached to the vehicle and is supported by a frame 50 . the truck includes a drive means ( not shown ) to power the belt so as to move particulate material ( not shown ) deposited onto the belt from the truck bed 14 or from a hopper . material may be deposited onto the belt directly from the truck bed 14 or an additional conveyor 54 may operate between the truck bed 14 and the belt 12 to transfer the material . the thrower belt 12 may be either smooth or ribbed . referring to fig2 the apparatus of the invention is generally shown at 11 . the apparatus includes an endless belt 16 located above the thrower belt 12 and adjacent to the outlet of the truck bed or hopper 14 . in a preferred embodiment the endless belt 16 is approximately the same width as the thrower belt 12 . in one embodiment , the endless belt 16 has ribs 30 located on the outer surface thereof and that run transverse to the direction of travel 32 . the ribs 30 assist in frictionally engaging the endless belt 16 and the thrower belt 12 . when the thrower belt 12 is in motion it drives the endless belt 16 as a result of the frictional engagement between the belts 12 and 16 . in another embodiment , the endless belt 16 may be smooth while still maintaining the frictional engagement with the thrower belt 12 . the frictional engagement may result from direct contact between the belts 12 and 16 or indirect contact , where the particulate material that is passing between the belts 12 and 16 transfers the motion from the thrower belt 12 to the endless belt 16 . the endless belt 16 extends around at least two pairs of wheels 22 rotatably attached to axles 24 mounted on opposite ends of a frame 54 which preferably comprises two longitudinal frame rails 20 extending along the length of endless belt 16 . in a preferred embodiment , the apparatus of the invention includes a plurality of pairs of wheels 22 positioned along the length of the belt 16 so as to provide adequate support therefor . the number of additional wheels 22 and axles 24 between the ends of the endless belt 16 will vary depending on the size of the endless belt 16 . in another embodiment , the wheels may be replaced with rollers . in yet another embodiment , the frame rails 20 may be replaced by a single longitudinal frame rail 20 . in a preferred embodiment , the endless belt 16 includes two rows of inner knobs 26 provided on the inner surface of the belt and along the length thereof . the knobs 26 are arranged so as to form two channels running longitudinally along the belt thereby providing a groove for the wheels 22 . the channels formed by the knobs 26 thereby serve to maintain the belt in alignment with the wheels . it will be appreciated that various other arrangements are possible for maintaining the belt 16 in the desired alignment . in a further preferred embodiment , the apparatus of the invention , 11 , is kept from moving in the direction of travel 32 by a pivoting linkage 28 . the linkage can be attached to any stationary part of the slinger such as the frame 50 . the other end of the linkage 28 is attached to the side rails 20 . it will be apparent that any other attachment means may be used . in a further preferred embodiment , a support 19 may be detachably fixed to the frame 50 . the support is u - shaped and extends across the top of the apparatus 11 and attaches to the frame 50 on both sides . in a preferred embodiment , depth stops , or ledges , 52 are located on either side of the support 19 adjacent to the frame rails 20 . the depth stops 52 are provided for supporting the apparatus 11 of the invention so that the full weight of the apparatus is prevented from resting on the thrower belt 12 . in addition , the support 19 restricts the vertical movement of the apparatus 11 so that it can only deflect a predetermined distance . in another embodiment , the depth stops may be omitted thereby allowing the thrower belt 12 to support the full weight of the apparatus 11 ; however , such an arrangement may lead to excessive wear or contortion of the belt 16 of the conveyor apparatus 11 . this problem may be averted by reinforcing the belt 16 to prevent bending thereof . in a further preferred embodiment , a shield 18 is located on top of the belt 16 . the rear end of the shield 18 is adjacent to the hopper 14 and the forward end of the shield 18 may overhang the belt 16 by several inches to control any kickback of material . the shield 18 is attached to the frame rails 20 . the shield 18 may have side guards 17 as shown in fig3 and which have been omitted from fig2 for clarity . referring to fig4 and 5 , the pivoting linkage 28 is comprised of one link 38 , which is attached to the conveyor assembly 11 at ball joints 44 and 46 . ball joint 44 is attached to the frame rail 24 and ball joint 46 is attached to the arch frame 19 . the joints are in the same horizontal plane , although this is not necessary . the link 38 can rotate freely about both joints 44 and 46 . now that the apparatus has been described , the mode of operation of the device will now be described . the thrower belt 12 is set in motion by the driving means of the truck . particulate material is released onto the thrower belt 12 . the material is carried along the thrower belt 12 and underneath the endless belt 16 . the thrower belt 12 frictionally engages the outer ribs 30 of the endless belt 16 so that material passes between the two belts . in the preferred embodiment , the frame rails 20 keep the axles 24 aligned and the inner knobs 26 on the belt 16 keep it located with respect to the wheels 22 . this configuration acts to keep the belt 16 in line with the thrower belt 12 as material passes under it . as the material is passed between the two belts it is forced to settle on the thrower belt 12 instead of bouncing around , as it would normally do . the shield 18 that is located on top of the belt 16 may overhang the conveyor slightly . although this is not essential , it is useful in order to deflect any material that may be stuck in the belt 16 and carried partway around before flying off . the shield 18 also ensures that any stones that are carried the entire way around stay on the belt 16 . the conveyor assembly 11 is equipped with a pivoting linkage 28 that allows temporary raising of the assembly 11 when large material passes between the belts 12 and 16 . the pivoting linkage 28 is attached to a stationary part of the slinger such as the frame 50 , in one embodiment , and the frame rails 20 . the maximum vertical deflection of the conveyor assembly 11 is controlled by the support 19 , which the conveyor assembly 11 cannot deflect beyond . the ability of the belt 16 to deflect vertically is useful when large particulate material is encountered . it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the apparatus of the invention can be utilized with any conveyor and with a variety of material . for example , particulate material may include sand , gravel , salt , rock etc . the conveyor may be associated with trucks ( as described above ) or with mining , equipment , farming equipment etc . in a further preferred embodiment , shown in fig6 a hydraulic motor 59 is bolted to frame rails 20 and connected to a drive axle 62 and two drive wheels 58 , which replace the front pair of wheels 22 . a series of hydraulic lines ( not shown ) connect hydraulic motor 59 with the same drive means ( not shown ) that powers belt 12 . the hydraulic motor 59 , thus drives the belt 16 on the wheels 22 to assist the conjoint movement of belts 12 and 16 . this embodiment is useful when conveying particulate materials to a higher elevation . in the previous embodiment , the endless belt 16 is driven by frictional engagement between belt 16 and thrower belt 12 , and slippage between these two belts may occur when frame 50 is elevated above a certain angle to convey particulate material to a higher elevation . in order to inhibit this slippage , the hydraulic motor 59 connected to the drive axle 62 and the two drive wheels 58 , will power the operation of belt 16 independent of any frictional engagement between belts 16 and 12 . further , since hydraulic motor 59 is connected to the drive means that powers belt 12 by hydraulic lines , the drives may be arranged so that the two belts 16 and 12 will run at the same speed . as a further alternative , either in combination with the motor 59 or in the arrangement of fig1 - 9 , the frictional engagement between belts 12 and 16 may be increased by a tensioning member 60 , one end of which is connected to frame 20 , and the opposite end of which is connected to arch frame 19 as shown in fig6 and 8 . adjustment of the tensioning member will increase or decrease the normal forces acting between the belts 12 , 16 , thereby varying the frictional engagement . in a further embodiment , nylon wear plates 17 , shown in fig7 and 9 , may be used to reduce the wear on the sides of the shield 18 and also help reduce the noise generated by apparatus 11 when it is in operation . outer deflectors 57 may also be mounted at either or both ends of shield 18 to minimize wet or sticky particulate material from being projected erratically due to the material adhering to belt 16 upon discharge of the material at the front of apparatus 11 or the kickback of any material at the rear of the apparatus 11 . the shield 18 may also have at least one angle rubber 55 , held by bracket 56 , at the rear end of apparatus 11 to help the particulate material from bouncing away before being carried along the thrower belt 12 and underneath the endless belt 16 . although the invention has been described with reference to certain specific embodiments , various modifications thereof will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as outlined in the claims appended hereto .
