referring to fig1 and 2 , there is shown a tattoo needle case constructed in accordance with a first preferred embodiment of the invention . the preferred embodiment is comprised of a seat 20 , a plurality of needles 30 , and a thermoplastic sheath 40 . each component will be described in detailed below . the rectangular seat 20 comprises a rear section 21 and a front section 22 formed integrally therewith . the rear section 21 comprises a plurality of lengthwise , parallel grooves 211 with the needles 30 disposed therein , a plurality of first risers 212 formed on one side , a plurality of second risers 213 formed on the other side , a cavity 221 provided on the front section 22 with the pointed ends 31 of the needles 30 disposed therein , a forward flat 222 , and a breaking section 25 interconnected the rear section 21 and the front section 22 and including a well 251 and two side openings 252 and 253 . the thermoplastic sheath 40 has a section of rectangle . the thermoplastic sheath 40 is sleeved on the seat 20 after placing the needles 30 on the grooves 211 of the rear section 21 . the thermoplastic sheath 40 is adapted to tightly wrap both the seat 20 and the needles 30 after being subject to heat . as a result , the needles 30 disposed in the rear section 21 are protected by the thermoplastic sheath 40 . the pointed ends 31 of the needles 30 are completely concealed in the cavity 221 after wrapping the seat 20 by the thermoplastic sheath 40 . thus , the invention can completely and satisfactorily solve the safety problem of being accidentally pricked during use . moreover , the needle storage is easy and reliable . in use , a user may hold the flat 222 to bend the front section 22 until the front section 22 is separate from the rear section 21 at the breaking section 25 ( i . e ., at the well 251 and the side openings 252 and 253 ). as a result , the pointed ends 31 are exposed . this process is quick , safe , and convenient . note that preferably , solder is applied around the seat 20 so that the fastening of the needles 30 can be successfully carried out by heating the solder and cooling thereafter . alternatively , tattoo needle case of the invention can be comprised of a seat 20 and a metal sheath 50 ( see fig8 ). the sheath 50 is sleeved on the rear section 21 . next , pressing the sheath 50 will tightly wrap both the rear section 21 and the needles 30 . as a result , the needles 30 disposed in the rear section 21 are protected . referring to fig3 , there is shown a tattoo needle case constructed in accordance with a second preferred embodiment of the invention . the second preferred embodiment substantially has same structure as the first preferred embodiment . the characteristics of the second preferred embodiment are detailed below . the case comprises a seat 20 , a plurality of needles 30 , and a thermoplastic sheath 40 . the rectangular seat 20 comprises a rear section 21 , a front section 22 formed integrally therewith , and a cover 23 put on the rear section 21 to form a receiving space 24 therebetween . the rectangular cover 23 comprises a plurality of lengthwise , parallel grooves 231 on its underside , a plurality of first flanges 232 formed on one side , and a plurality of second flanges 233 formed on the other side . similarly , the rear section 21 comprises a plurality of parallel grooves 211 with the needles 30 disposed therein , a plurality of first risers 212 formed on one side , a plurality of second risers 213 formed on the other side , a cavity 221 provided on the front section 22 with the pointed ends 31 of the needles 30 disposed therein , a forward flat 222 , and a breaking section 25 interconnected the rear section 21 and the front section 22 and including a well 251 and two side openings 252 and 253 . the grooves 231 are adapted to engage with upper portions of the needles 30 when the cover 23 is put on the rear section 21 . as such , the needles 30 are tightly retained by both the cover 23 ( i . e ., the grooves 231 ) and the rear section 21 ( i . e ., the grooves 211 ). note that each of the receiving space 24 and the cavity 221 has a sufficient height so as to successfully store the needles 30 therein . the thermoplastic sheath 40 has a section of rectangle . the thermoplastic sheath 40 is sleeved on the seat 20 after putting the cover 23 on the rear section 21 and placing the needles 30 in the grooves 211 in the receiving space 24 thereafter . the thermoplastic sheath 40 is adapted to tightly wrap both the seat 20 and the needles 30 after being subject to heat . as a result , the needles 30 disposed in the rear section 21 are protected by the thermoplastic sheath 40 . moreover , preferably , liquid adhesive is applied after placing the needles 30 in the rear section 21 and sleeving the thermoplastic sheath 40 thereon . as such , the fastening of the needles 30 can be successfully carried out by heating the adhesive and cooling thereafter . still preferably , solder is applied so that the fastening of the needles 30 can be further enhanced by heating the solder and cooling thereafter . likewise , the pointed ends 31 of the needles 30 are completely concealed in the cavity 221 after wrapping the seat 20 by the thermoplastic sheath 40 . thus , the invention can completely and satisfactorily solve the safety problem of being accidentally pricked during use . moreover , the needle storage is easy and reliable . in use , a user may hold the flat 222 to bend the front section 22 until the front section 22 is separate from the rear section 21 at the breaking section 25 ( i . e ., at the well 251 and the side openings 252 and 253 ). as a result , the pointed ends 31 are exposed . this process is quick , safe , and convenient . referring to fig4 , there is shown a tattoo needle case constructed in accordance with a third preferred embodiment of the invention . the third preferred embodiment substantially has same structure as the second preferred embodiment . the characteristics of the third preferred embodiment are detailed below . the cavity 221 is a parallelogram and comprises an oblique side 221 a such that the pointed ends 31 of the needles 30 can be arranged along the oblique side 221 a . each of the front end of the cover 23 ′ and the breaking section 25 ′ is oblique and is substantially parallel to the side 221 a . the lengths of the needles 30 ′ exposed from the cover 23 ′ and the breaking section 25 ′ are about the same after breaking the front section 22 . in other words , the prolonged portions of the obliquely disposed needles 30 ′ can be supported by the breaking section 25 ′ and the front end of the cover 23 ′ by the provisions of the breaking section 25 ′ and the cover 23 ′. as a result , strength of the seat 20 can be enhanced for accommodating elongated needles . note that each of the front end of the cover 23 ′ and the breaking section 25 ′ can be formed as a curve or arc depending on applications . also , the pointed ends 31 of the needles 30 ′ are in close proximity with the curve or arc . referring to fig5 and 5 a , needles 30 are arranged in two layers and three layers in the receiving space 24 formed by the rear section 21 and the cover 23 respectively . the two - layer or three - layer arrangement can provide a convenient and quick use of the needles . referring to fig6 and 6 a , the grooves 231 of the cover 23 are engaged with the corresponding grooves 211 of rear section 21 . also , the cover 23 are spaced apart from the rear section 21 by the side flanges 232 . in a mounting operation , first place the needles 30 in the receiving space 24 and next put the cover 23 thereon for concealing the needles 30 . next , put the thermoplastic sheath 40 thereon and heat the same for fastening . referring to fig7 and 7 a , needles 30 are arranged in two layers and three layers in the rear section 21 respectively . next , put the thermoplastic sheath 40 thereon and heat the same for fastening both the rear section 21 and the needles . referring to fig8 and 8 a , needles 30 are arranged in two layers and three layers in the rear section 21 respectively . next , put the metal sheath 50 thereon . next , pressing the sheath 50 will tightly wrap both the rear section 21 and the needles 30 . as a result , the needles 30 disposed in the rear section 21 are protected . while the invention herein disclosed has been described by means of specific embodiments , numerous modifications and variations could be made thereto by those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention set forth in the claims .
