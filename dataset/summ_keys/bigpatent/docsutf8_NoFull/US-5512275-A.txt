this present patent application pertains to a use of a coal tar formulation , in combination with other named and related ingredients to help sustain the hair shaft &# 39 ; s growth cycle in the anagen phase and assist in the formation of new shafts . the exact mechanism by which this is accomplished is not known by the inventor , however , the medicinal affects of coal tar for the treatment of psoriasis have been well established , as discussed above , and are known to have a metabolic effect on skin cells , including the epidermal layer of the scalp . the remaining ingredients assist in the delivery of the liquor carbonis detergens to the dermal papilla by acting as fat / oil emollients , stimulants , and other supporting agents as discussed below . the invention includes liquor carbonis detergens and may include salicylic acid , spirits of camphor , castor oil , isopropyl alcohol and , other adjuvants , analogues , cosmetic perfumes , derivatives and agents , such as retin - a , minoxidil , known or claimed to retard hair shedding or regenerate growth or support those processes , such as : cpa ( cyproterone acetate ), growth stimulating factors ( supernatants ), sulfates , pyrimidines , hexosaccharic acid , salts and esters thereof , pyroglutamic acid and esters thereof , and anti - androgens . it is hypothesized that any one of several biochemical cellular and molecular disturbances that occur during the anagen phase or catagen phase of subjects with androgenic alopecia are corrected or improved metabolically either in the functioning or formation of the stem cells , their migration process or during the mitosis phase of keratin production within the follicular papilla and matrix . a preferred embodiment for the present invention is a composition with the following component percentages : ______________________________________component parts of solution % ______________________________________liquor carbonis detergens ( coal tar ) 8 4 . 4salicylic acid 2 1 . 1spirits of camphor 30 16 . 7castor oil ( or similar oil ) 2 1 . 1isopropyl alcohol 138 76 . 7perfume ( range ) adjuvents * total 180 100 . 0______________________________________ * such as , minoxidil , retina , cpa ( cyproterone acetate ), growth stimulatin factors ( supernatants ), sulfates , pyrimidines , hexosaccharic acid , salts and esters thereof , pyroglutamic acid and esters thereof , and antiandrogens , which can be factored in as desired . the action and function of the ingredients for the treatment of alopecia by topical application to the scalp are as follows : liquor carbonis detergens ( lcd ) is a light - yellow , thin , oily liquid form of coal tar , also called pixabol , which is a by - product in the destructive distillation of coal . lcd is an amalgam constituted of benzene , toluene , naphthalene , anthracene , zyleen and other aromatic hydrocarbons ; phenol , cresol , and other phenol bodies ; ammonia , pyridine , and some other organic bases ; and thiophenean . liquor carbonis detergens ( an alcohol extract of crude coal tar ) is traditionally characterized as a thin lubricant and moisturizing agent capable of mechanically separating epithelial cells resulting in a loosening and softening ( also called desquamation ) of skin scales and crusts softens the scales and crusts , and helps correct abnormalities of keratinization by decreasing epidermal proliferation and dermal infiltration . liquor carbonis detergens also has antiseptic qualities derived from its substituted phenols and works as a minor irritant , stimulating the capillaries to increase blood flow to the follicular papilla . lcd may function as an inhibitor of enzyme catalytic activity in a number of ways . among them , lcd could either degrade , polarize , or cause physical or chemical changes to enzymes such that their effect upon the cells of the follicular papilla and elsewhere becomes diminished . since enzymes are also denatured by changes to the ph level , it is possible that coal tar alters the ph level in the dermal papilla ( where enzymes are active ) from the normal neutral to slightly alkaline state ( 7 . 8 to 8 . 1 ) to a more acidic level , thereby compromising the functioning of the androgen enzymes which are believed by many to be responsible for alopecia . coal tar has long been known to block cell uptake of vitamin d which , in turn , permits penetration of uv light radiation as a therapy for psoriasis and shingles . this inventor would suggest that coal tar &# 39 ; s efficacy in retarding alopecia is based upon a different androgen blocker reaction , that of hormonal activity suppression . lcd &# 39 ; s possible role in the metabolic functions of oxygen - carrying isozymes within the cell and in the migration of stem cells from the bulge region to the follicular papilla are also identified and will be clinically explored along with enzyme reactions . salicylic acid works as a blood flow stimulant and as a keratolytic agent , bactericide and an adjunct in fungal infections which may be present on the scalp and inhibiting the normal functioning of the hair root bulb . salicylic acid also serves to dissolve skin oils and reduce their viscosity within the sebaceous glands and ducts . spirits of camphor ( dissolved crystals ) is a mild rubefacient , analgesics antiseptic and antipruritic with mildly irritating and stimulating properties affecting capillary action . isopropyl alcohol ( isopropanol ) serves as a solvent of surface oils , antiseptic , stimulant of blood flow , and media in which the other ingredients are dissolved . oil of ricine ( castor oil ) is used to improve the regrowth or epithelialization of skin cells by reducing premature epithelial desiccation and cornification . it also acts as a protective covering to the irritated surface skin cells . while the exact interaction of the above ingredients is not completely understood , it is hypothesized that the shortening of the anagen phase which occurs in those with androgenic alopecia and the resulting gradual shrinkage of the hair follicle itself while , conversely , the sebaceous glands enlarge , can be delayed or inhibited by chemical intervention to the region &# 39 ; s cells with the result that strong blood and oxygen flow is maintained and / or physical or chemical inhibitors to normal cell function and migration are minimized . androgenic alopecia , an inherited trait that clinically commences with the shedding of over 100 strands per day . the inventor believes that healthy subjects experiencing androgenic alopecia can return to normal shedding rates with regular and sustained usage of the formula at a dose of about 4 to 8 ml per day , applied as a lotion to the scalp morning and evenings preferably after shampooing . the present invention carries with it none of the health risks associated with minoxidil use . the ingredients are inexpensive and plentiful and can be manufactured and distributed at a selling price affordable to the vast majority of the 55 million u . s . citizens experiencing androgenic alopecia . the following examples will serve to further typify the nature of the invention but should not be construed as a limitation on the scope thereof which is defined solely by the appended claims . at the age of 47 female subject noticed the onset of alopecia ( a loss of 250 shafts per day ). medical history and blood tests at this onset did not identify a cause other than genetic . the formula was applied topically twice daily and the subject experienced a recovery within six months . she has since maintained a regimen of 1 × daily applications and has avoided recurrence of the symptoms . male caucasian , aged 48 was experiencing androgenic alopecia for approximately 10 years and had been using rogaine for at least five of those years . he reported that , while effluvium continued , a 1 × per day regimen of rogaine applications appeared to stall the process somewhat . the subject , however , was experiencing weight gain and decided to discontinue rogaine usage for this reason . he was also concerned about its long term possible affects on his heart . the subject began 1 × daily applications of the formula and reported results identical to rogaine ( 1 ×/ day usage ), that is , minimum hair loss . when the subject discontinued use of the formula for more than a week he reported higher effluvium rates .
