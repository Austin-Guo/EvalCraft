mating coacting ball and socket means are provided at the connecting midriff portions of the torsos and a flexible connector extends through a bushing aperture formed integrally with the ball to define the axis of pivoting , the connector being fixedly secured within one torso member and rotatably secured within the other , the connector maintaining the portions together under tension with the pivotal connection providing a large range of compound positions and relationships between the upper and lower torsos of the doll .
referring now to the drawings and particularly to fig1 3 , there is shown a doll construction including a lower torso member generally designated 12 and an upper torso member generally designated 14 , the upper torso member 14 being pivotally secured to the lower torso member 12 .
