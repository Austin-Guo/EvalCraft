a brake cylinder maintaining system that combines a brake cylinder maintaining check valve and a quick service limiting valve into a single unit to have lower hysteresis , and thus more precise bcm regulation pressure and a smaller pressure offset .
the check valve and quick service valve are coupled to provide a single system having multiple valve seats for selective communication between quick service pressure and brake cylinder pressure on one hand , and between a brake cylinder maintaining pressure and brake cylinder pressure on the other hand .
referring now to the drawings , wherein like reference numerals refer to like parts throughout , there is seen in fig1 a first embodiment of a brake cylinder maintaining valve 10 that integrates a quick service limiting valve and a bcm reference pressure charging check valve into a single unitary structure that cooperates to provide all of the relevant functions with more precise control that otherwise possible .
