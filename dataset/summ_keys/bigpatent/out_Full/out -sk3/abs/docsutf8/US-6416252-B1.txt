the barrier includes phosphate , and techniques are disclosed for forming specifically apatite barriers .
the method includes injecting dilute reagents into soil in proximity to a contamination plume or source such as a waste drum to achieve complete or partial encapsulation of the waste .
controlled temperature and ph facilitates rapid formation of apatite , for example , where dilute aqueous calcium chloride and dilute aqueous sodium phosphate are the selected reagents .
