the invention relates to a device for damping an upper suspension part in at least one spatial direction with respect to a lower suspension part movable relative thereto , wherein a spring apparatus which acts between the upper suspension part and the lower suspension part is provided for damping , wherein an actuating element is provided by way of which a force can be introduced into the device bidirectionally in the operating direction of the spring apparatus , wherein the actuating element is actuable via a control apparatus .
in the present case , the spring means 3 consists of a scissor type support apparatus 6 and of a spring 5 in the form of an air spring , by means of which movements in a vertical direction z can be damped .
in this respect the scissor type support apparatus 6 consists of a first scissors 10 and a second scissors 13 .
