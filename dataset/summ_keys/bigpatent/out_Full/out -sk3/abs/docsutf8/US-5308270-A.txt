the buoy is pedo shaped with a collapsible obturator tail fin section removably attached at the tail end , standard electronics in a mid section and an explosive nose cone at the front .
immediately after launch , the tail fin section expands to exert a drag on the buoy to halt any forward motion .
the tail fin section is discarded and the nose cone and mid section portion rise until the nose impacts the underside of the ice .
