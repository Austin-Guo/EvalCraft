the present invention provides such a spherical block structure wherein each spherical block is made up of three intersecting rings corresponding to the three axes of the sphere .
the spherical block structure created by the intersecting rings results in a hollow center with eight cavities radiating outward , the cavities providing a location for the disposition of a connection means whereby individual spherical blocks may be releasably connected to form larger structures .
the spherical building block of the present invention is derived from a cube and is , itself , the product of a plurality of squares folded and assembled to form the individual subunits that are joined together to form the intersecting rings .
