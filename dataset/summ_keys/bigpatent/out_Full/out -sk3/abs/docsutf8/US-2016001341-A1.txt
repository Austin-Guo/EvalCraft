a method for producing a torsional profile from a tubular hollow profile , the torsional profile being provided , over its entire length , with spaced apart walls , is provided .
the method includes placing the tubular hollow profile into a first deformation die , positioning the ends of the tubular hollow profile in the first deformation die by means of in each case one tapering first mandrel which extends into a torsional region , positioning the tubular hollow profile over its longitudinal extent in the first deformation die , deforming the tubular hollow profile over its longitudinal extent in the torsional region by means of a first punch , with a reduction in the tube cross sectional area in the torsional region , and removing the first punch and the first mandrels .
fig1 to 9 are different illustrations showing the production of an exemplary embodiment of a torsional profile according to the invention by means of the method according to the invention for producing a torsional profile from a tubular hollow profile 1 .
