sympathetic nerves run through the adventitia surrounding renal arteries and are critical in the modulation of systemic hypertension .
hypertension can be treated with neuromodulating agents , but requires adherence to strict regimens and often does not reach target blood pressure threshold to reduce risk of major cardiovascular events .
a minimally invasive solution is presented here to reduce the activity of the sympathetic nerves surrounding the renal artery by locally delivering neurotoxic or sympathetic nerve blocking agents into the adventitia .
