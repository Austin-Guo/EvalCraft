in electron beam lithography , a beam of incident electrons exposes a preselected circuit pattern in a thin resist layer deposited on top of a substrate to be etched .
some of the electrons scatter from the substrate back into the resist layer producing an undesired exposure which produces variable resolution of features .
in accordance with the disclosed technique , the region of the resist which is complementary to the desired circuit pattern is also exposed by an electron beam which has been adjusted to produce an exposure approximating that due to backscattering .
