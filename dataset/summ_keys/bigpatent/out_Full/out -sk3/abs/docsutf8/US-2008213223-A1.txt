the present invention relates to gene transfer and gene therapy technology .
more specifically , the invention provides compositions and methods for targeted virus delivery .
this simple mixing causes less inactivation than chemically linking the ligand to the virus and therefore results in a more active therapeutic composition than obtained by methods which utilize crosslinking agents .
