an improved iontophoresis device for topical administration of ionic drugs or chemicals through epidermal tissue for anesthetizing or sterilizing local tissue or for applying various medicaments without mechanical penetration .
an ionic form of drug is conducted through the epidermal tissue by means of direct current generated from a battery powered current source .
pulse width modulated dc current is regulated by feedback circuitry which varies the pulse duration and adjusts and stabilizes the average current at a desired level .
