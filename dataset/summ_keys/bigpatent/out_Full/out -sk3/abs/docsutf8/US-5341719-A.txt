a multi layer composite gun barrel has an integral metal alloy jacket portion , forming the exterior cylinder of the entire barrel , with a forebarrel interior liner cylinder substantially bonded within the jacket portion , and an unbonded breech portion liner , made from a high melting temperature refractory metal alloy able to resist erosion by hot gun gases in the barrel breech area .
the jacket / liner portions are formed from a tubular coextrusion cylinder of concentric material layers carefully selected to include compatible materials , such as nickel , iron and cobalt base superalloys .
the boreliner portion 20 can be fabricated of a more expensive high density refractory metal alloy which can withstand the very high breech temperature .
