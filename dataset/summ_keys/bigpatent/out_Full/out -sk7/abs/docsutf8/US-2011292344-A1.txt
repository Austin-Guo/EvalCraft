to provide spectral output selectivity and brightness flexibility , a plurality of color light sources are selectively combined to produce an illuminating light having a desired spectral output .
in this fashion , a clinician may thus not only alter the spectral output for the illumination but also vary ( or keep constant ) the resulting luminous flux despite the spectral augmentation .
each led associates with a corresponding collimating lens .
because of the rgb contribution from the sources , combined light beam 140 may nominally be a white light beam .
to provide spectral variability in addition to white light illumination , the radiant flux ( intensity ) for each light source may be tuned as desired .
other techniques may also be used to vary or tune the light intensity from each source .
for example , constant power sources may drive the leds through pulse width modulators .
