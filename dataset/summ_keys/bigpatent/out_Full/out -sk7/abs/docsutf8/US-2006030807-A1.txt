a portable lumbar traction device is wherein a variable tension system allows the user to manually manipulate a level of tension using a ratcheting device while undergoing a traction procedure .
the invention easily and quickly anchors to a door frame and includes one or more springs to create tension in the device .
a belt or harness worn by the user couples to a cable or tether in tension with the spring , and the ratcheting device incrementally increases the tension when actuated by the user until the desired tension level is achieved .
the present invention is a tensioning device that is portable and capable of mounting or connecting to a common door frame or fixed structure that selectively applies lumbar traction to a patient .
the device of the present invention includes an anchoring section that can be used to secure the device to a door frame or the like , a tension producing section that includes a mechanical spring coupled to a ratchet mechanism for increasing the spring & # 39 ; s tension , and a belt or harness section that is worn by the user .
the belt or harness can be used in conjunction with a pad or mat that incorporates a frictional surface that resists sliding of the pad or mat on the supporting surface such as a carpet , grass , or floor .
the anchoring section of the lumbar device in a first embodiment is a non resilient nylon tether 15 or belt connected at a distal end 20 to a plastic pipe 25 as shown in fig1 and 2 .
