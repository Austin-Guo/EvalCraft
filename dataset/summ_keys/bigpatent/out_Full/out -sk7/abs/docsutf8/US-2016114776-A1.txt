a brake cylinder maintaining system that combines a brake cylinder maintaining check valve and a quick service limiting valve into a single unit to have lower hysteresis , and thus more precise bcm regulation pressure and a smaller pressure offset .
the check valve and quick service valve are coupled to provide a single system having multiple valve seats for selective communication between quick service pressure and brake cylinder pressure on one hand , and between a brake cylinder maintaining pressure and brake cylinder pressure on the other hand .
referring now to the drawings , wherein like reference numerals refer to like parts throughout , there is seen in fig1 a first embodiment of a brake cylinder maintaining valve 10 that integrates a quick service limiting valve and a bcm reference pressure charging check valve into a single unitary structure that cooperates to provide all of the relevant functions with more precise control that otherwise possible .
nozzle 14 extends along a longitudinal axis through a brake cylinder pressure chamber 20 in an upper portion of a bushing 22 and through a narrow passageway 24 that separates brake cylinder pressure chamber 20 from a quick service pressure chamber 26 defined in a lower portion of bushing 22 .
it should be recognized that the various chambers are in communication with the corresponding elements of a conventional braking system such that the pressure in a particular chamber reflects the pressure in the corresponding element of the braking system .
for example , brake cylinder pressure chamber 20 is in open communication with a brake cylinder ( not shown ) so that the pressure in chamber 20 reflects the pressure in the brake cylinder .
nozzle 14 extends through brake cylinder pressure chamber 20 and into quick service pressure chamber 26 to define a first seat a , which selectively controls communication between a bcm reference pressure chamber 28 positioned above qslv diaphragm 18 and brake cylinder pressure chamber 20 , as well as a second seat b , which selectively controls communication between quick service pressure chamber 26 and brake cylinder pressure chamber 20 .
