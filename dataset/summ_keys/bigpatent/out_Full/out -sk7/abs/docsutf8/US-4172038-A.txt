in a tubular filter bodies with at least one tubular filter structure with a porous wall , through which a liquid passes substantially radially , particles above a given size being held back at the entrance surface , made of porous plastic , ceramic material , metal , graphite , etc , continuous operation at constant pressures is made possible by providing at least one groove which is closed toward the outside and forms a forced flow path leading from an inlet to an outlet in the circumferential entrance surface of the tubular filter body .
the partition 6 has cutouts , in which tubes 8 are arranged parallel to the axis of the tube in a pressure tight manner .
the tubes 8 are arranged in the cross section of the housing 1 in such a manner that as many tubes as possible can be accommodated .
their outer circumferential surface is the circumferential entrance surface .
the filter bodies 9 themselves are tubular and are closed off by plugs 11 at their ends facing the cover 3 .
at their outer circumference , the filter bodies 9 have a helical groove 12 , which forms a helical canal for the liquid between the filter body 9 and the inner circumference of the tube 8 .
the liquid can enter the canal at the inlet 13 located at the left in fig1 and can leave it again at the outlet 14 located at the right in fig1 .
