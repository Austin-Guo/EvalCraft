the barrier includes phosphate , and techniques are disclosed for forming specifically apatite barriers .
the method includes injecting dilute reagents into soil in proximity to a contamination plume or source such as a waste drum to achieve complete or partial encapsulation of the waste .
controlled temperature and ph facilitates rapid formation of apatite , for example , where dilute aqueous calcium chloride and dilute aqueous sodium phosphate are the selected reagents .
mixing of reagents to form precipitate is mediated and enhanced through movement of reagents in soil as a result of phenomena including capillary action , movement of groundwater , soil washing and reagent injection pressure .
as indicated above , the present invention provides an alternative to current contaminant sequestration or soil removal methods .
according to the invention , a truly in situ procedure utilizes , for example , the capillary action of the soil to disseminate and help mix injected water soluble reagents , which will react and chemically form the reactive barrier in the soil itself .
the solutions contain chemical reagents which react in the soil and cause precipitation of a specific mineral that is targeted to sequester radioactive materials and heavy metals .
