an additive manufacturing process performed by an additive manufacturing machine includes strain gauges that detect stress within a part during fabrication within a defined workspace .
when the detected stress is exceeds a desired level the fabrication steps are paused and a stress relieving process is performed within the chamber without moving the part .
the additive manufacturing machine includes heaters and coolers for changing the temperature within the chamber to perform the desired stress relieving process in the same space as fabrication is performed .
once it is confirmed that stresses within the part are within acceptable limits the part fabrication process is resumed .
the example material 24 is a metal powder that is applied in a layer over the support 14 and subsequent layers to produce a desired configuration of the part 16 .
the laser beam 20 emits directs energy that melts the powder material in a configuration that forms the desired part dimensions .
the additive manufacturing process proceeds by melting subsequent layers of powdered material 24 that are applied to the part 16 to form the desired part configuration .
