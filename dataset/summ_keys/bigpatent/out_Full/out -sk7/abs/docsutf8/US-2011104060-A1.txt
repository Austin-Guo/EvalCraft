sympathetic nerves run through the adventitia surrounding renal arteries and are critical in the modulation of systemic hypertension .
hypertension can be treated with neuromodulating agents , but requires adherence to strict regimens and often does not reach target blood pressure threshold to reduce risk of major cardiovascular events .
a minimally invasive solution is presented here to reduce the activity of the sympathetic nerves surrounding the renal artery by locally delivering neurotoxic or sympathetic nerve blocking agents into the adventitia .
extended elution of these agents may also be accomplished in order to tailor the therapy to the patient .
the present invention will preferably utilize microfabricated catheters for intravascular injection .
a more complete description of the catheters and methods for their fabrication is provided in u .
the present invention describes methods and kits useful for the delivery of neuromodulating agents into the adventitia around renal arteries in order to reduce blood pressure in the treatment of hypertension .
