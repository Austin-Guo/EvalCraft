a resilient , shock absorption assembly that mounts between available sail rigging lines and a boat hull .
in one assembly , a piston is resiliently biased relative to a housing and contained spring to permit reciprocating movement .
couplers at distal ends of the piston and housing attach to suitable rigging lines and / or the boat .
in other assemblies , resilient elastomer cores bias movement of a piston or cable .
in another assembly fitted within a main sail boom , a cable biases the boom rigging lines .
one or more separate resilient assemblies can be coupled to the sail .
the cable mast and rigging lines are thus made resilient to counterbalance the boat against heeling with the presence of rough water and gusty winds .
