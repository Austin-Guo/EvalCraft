a collapsible container configured to lay substantially flat in a collapsed position and maintain an extended or usable position by utilizing load bearing means rigidly disposed among and affixed to various support members .
the load bearing means are adapted to receive support members and sustain the container in its usable position when a load is placed therein .
the load bearing means resist movement of support members in the direction caused by the load exerted on the container .
when the load is removed , the load bearing means is adapted to permit the support members to be withdrawn there from so that the container may be transitioned to a substantially flat collapsed position .
the container 10 may include a plurality of support members such as loop segments 12 circumferentially disposed around a base member such as a circular rim 14 .
the loop segments 12 may be disposed around rim 14 so that the first distal end 13 of one loop segment 12 overlaps the second distal end 15 of the adjacent loop segment 12 immediately next to it .
a plurality of stoppers 17 may be disposed on the circumference of rim 14 to prevent movement of the distal ends of the loop segments 12 outside a predetermined distance on the rim 14 .
