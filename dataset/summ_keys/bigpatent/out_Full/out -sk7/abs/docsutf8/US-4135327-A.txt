a doll construction having upper and lower generally hollow torso members adapted to be supported in an upright position along the longitudinal center line of the doll and to be pivoted with respect to each other about an axis disposed angularly at approximately 30 Â° from the longitudinal center line .
mating coacting ball and socket means are provided at the connecting midriff portions of the torsos and a flexible connector extends through a bushing aperture formed integrally with the ball to define the axis of pivoting , the connector being fixedly secured within one torso member and rotatably secured within the other , the connector maintaining the portions together under tension with the pivotal connection providing a large range of compound positions and relationships between the upper and lower torsos of the doll .
referring now to the drawings and particularly to fig1 3 , there is shown a doll construction including a lower torso member generally designated 12 and an upper torso member generally designated 14 , the upper torso member 14 being pivotally secured to the lower torso member 12 .
the upper torso member 14 is likewise generally hollow and formed from two halves or shells including a rear half 28 and a front half 30 suitably joined and configured to form the chest and back surfaces of the doll .
the upper portion of the upper torso terminates in a neck projection 32 to which is suitably secured a head ( not shown ) .
the upper surface of the lower torso member 12 terminates in a ball surface 38 at the midriff or waist portion of the lower torso member 12 where the two torso member portions are interconnected .
the upper torso member 14 , as will hereinafter be described , terminates in a skirt portion 40 , which defines the waist or midriff portion thereof , the skirt portion 40 having an arcuately figure peripheral edge forming socket means to matingly coact and slide with respect to the ball surface 38 .
