the present invention relates to gene transfer and gene therapy technology .
more specifically , the invention provides compositions and methods for targeted virus delivery .
this simple mixing causes less inactivation than chemically linking the ligand to the virus and therefore results in a more active therapeutic composition than obtained by methods which utilize crosslinking agents .
the presence of mtp53 and the consequent absence of a g1 block have also been found to correlate with increased radiation resistance in some human tumors and cell lines .
however , some conflicting reports indicate that the relationship between p53 expression and chemoresistance may have a tissue or cell type specific component .
the present invention addresses the need to deliver therapeutic molecules systemically with a high degree of target cell specificity and high efficiency .
specific embodiments of the invention provide pharmaceutically acceptable compositions comprising an admixture of transferrin ligand and viral vector particles capable of delivering a nucleic acid to target host cells .
