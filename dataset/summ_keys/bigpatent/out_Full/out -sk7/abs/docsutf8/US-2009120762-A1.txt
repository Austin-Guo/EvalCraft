the invention relates to a drive system for moving walkways and stairs by means of horizontal drive chains , having a drive actuation mechanism and drive chains responsible for causing the movement of the plates of the walkway or steps of the stairs .
the drive chains and the pallets or steps have direct mutual engagement devices which are opposite and coupled to one another along a straight section of the path of the belt or stairs .
the devices have deformable rollers which are assembled in the links of the drive chain and engage in complementary cavities that the plates or links have at the back part .
a detailed description of a drive system for a moving walkway formed according to the invention will be made below , and it must be understood that the described concepts are equally applicable to moving stairs and other conveyor systems .
the output shaft of the reducer 3 moves in each case the gear wheel 4 which in turn drives the horizontal drive chains 1 .
these chains carry deformable rollers 5 engaging with opposing housings that the plates 6 of the moving walkway have on the rear surface .
fig4 and 5 show plan and perspective views of a horizontal drive chain horizontal for the drive system of the invention .
