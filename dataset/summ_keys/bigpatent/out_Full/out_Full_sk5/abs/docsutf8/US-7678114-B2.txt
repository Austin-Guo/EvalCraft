a surgical installation tool to insert a vertebral implant into a patient includes an elongated handle and a head attached to one end .
the head may include an engagement member that is movable between engaged and released positions .
the engagement member may be outwardly biased so that it naturally rests in the released position .
a reactive force caused by the inward deflection may supply the attachment force between the installation tool and the vertebral implant .
the attachment between the vertebral implant to the installation tool may be maintained while the engagement member is in the engaged position .
