a motor vehicle support group for mounting an instrument and control device carrier assembly , accessory elements , and an electric interconnection group for the instruments , control devices and accessory elements , in the passenger compartment of the motor vehicle , the support group comprising a first support part and a second support part adapted to be adjustably secured together , the first support part being mounted on the steering column of the motor vehicle and the second support part being mounted on the dashboard of the vehicle , the support parts and the components mounted thereon being adapted to be preassembled so that the assembly may be tested prior to installation in the motor vehicle .
support part 2 comprises a substantially cylindrical tube provided at its front end with an annular rim 5 having an axial bore 6 .
projecting from the lower region of the cylindrical support part 2 is a hollow cylindrical part 14 whose axis is orthogonal to the support part 2 and in which there may be accomodated an ignition key switch of known type ( not shown ) and a steering lock device ( of known type ) which controls the engagement and disengagement of a latch 15 with a steering wheel hub 16 .
projecting from the rear end of the cylindrical support part 2 are two side projections 18 which are bent orthogonally toward the outside and in the ends of which there are formed two longitudinal slots 19 in which there are accomodated , with a possibility of adjustment , the two screws 4 which serve to fix to the two projections 18 to the respective vertical projections 20 of the support part 3 .
support part 3 , instead of being die cast , is conveniently made of a shaped sheet plate having a substantially rectangular planar central portion 22 which is bent upwardly at its front end so as to define a horizontal portion 23 at a level higher than the central portion 22 , and from the front end of which two projections 20 extend downwardly .
