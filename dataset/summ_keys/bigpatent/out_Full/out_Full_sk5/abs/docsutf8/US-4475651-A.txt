a roll wrapping apparatus and method where rolls are wrapped with an envelope of heat shrink plastic film with a label positioned between the envelope and roll and electrostatically bonded to the film .
the bond prevents misalignment of the label prior to heat shrinking of the film onto the roll .
film feed assembly 22 maintains a taut curtain 23 of thermoplastic film extending across the work zone upstream of the sealing jaws .
label transfer assembly 26 transfers labels from feeder 24 to the work zone immediately upstream of the film curtain maintained by assembly 22 .
an electrostatic charging assembly 30 includes a grounding bar 32 extending across the width of the film curtain on the downstream side of the curtain and an applicator bar 34 extending across the width of the upstream side of the curtain across from the grounding bar .
