the present invention provides a slide guide for a press which comprises a gib structure with a spherical surface .
the gibs are formed on a frame of the press .
the spherical surface is provided with a holder or a cap to cover the spherical surface .
the surface contacts are formed between the spherical surface bodies and the gibs or between the caps and the gibs .
forming spherical contact surfaces prevents damage to the sliding surface .
