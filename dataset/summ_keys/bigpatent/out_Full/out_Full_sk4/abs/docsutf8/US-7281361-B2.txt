the method for portioning discrete articles by feeding the articles and generating signals controlling the gates is suited for a combined plurality of such assemblies to provide high speed continuous container filling operations for simultaneous filling of groups of containers .
at a top of the assembly , articles received from a feeder enter feed tube 2 and fall through an article detecting unit 10 , preferably a light sensing detector of the type according to the aforementioned u .
this arrangement allows for easy , rapid disassembly of the counting head assembly for inspection , cleaning and maintenance without tools , as the front wall 19 may be easily removed from the front of counting head assembly 1 by sliding upwards a short distance and lifting over the retaining pin 21 .
the pressure applied by pin 21 to seal the edges of front wall 19 against the sides of the chamber is preferably adjustable , for example , by use of a threaded pin or pin cap , or , as illustrated in fig1 b , with a bushing and lock ring apparatus 22 at the rear of the chamber which draws the pin towards the rear of the chamber .
