the rigid shaft may be straight or may be preformed in a selected curved configuration .
in an alternative embodiment of the invention , a malleable shaft is permanently attached to said camera .
using a malleable shaft offers the advantage that the shaft is manually manipulable into various configurations to facilitate access to different surgical sites , with the shaft having the ability to remain in each selected configuration until manually reformed into another configuration .
using a detachable shaft provides the advantage that different shafts may be used with the same camera to provide different endoscope configurations for different applications .
