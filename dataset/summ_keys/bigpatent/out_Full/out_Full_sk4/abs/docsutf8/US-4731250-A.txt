the invention relates to a method and an arrangement for the continuous heat treatment and packaging of a liquid product with the object of sterilizing the product , the product being heated for a short time together with , and surrounded by , the packing material wherein it is to be enclosed .
heat is transmitted to the product with the help of the metal bands while the product present between the metal bands is kept under pressure .
as can be seen from fig1 the arrangement consists of two endless bands 1 which are assumed here to be steel bands but which may also be other , preferably thermally conducting , bands or reinforced plastic bands .
the parts of the steel bands 1 facing one another form a gap 19 and the size of this gap is determined by supporting or guiding surfaces 11 over which the steel bands 1 are conducted .
