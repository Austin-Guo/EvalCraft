the barrier includes phosphate , and techniques are disclosed for forming specifically apatite barriers .
the method includes injecting dilute reagents into soil in proximity to a contamination plume or source such as a waste drum to achieve complete or partial encapsulation of the waste .
controlled temperature and ph facilitates rapid formation of apatite , for example , where dilute aqueous calcium chloride and dilute aqueous sodium phosphate are the selected reagents .
mixing of reagents to form precipitate is mediated and enhanced through movement of reagents in soil as a result of phenomena including capillary action , movement of groundwater , soil washing and reagent injection pressure .
