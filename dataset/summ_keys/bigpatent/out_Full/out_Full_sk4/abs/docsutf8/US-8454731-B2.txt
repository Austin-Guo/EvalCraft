vapor liquid contacting apparatuses comprising a primary contacting zone and a secondary contacting zone are disclosed .
a representative secondary contacting zone is a secondary absorption zone , such as a finishing zone for subsequent contacting of the vapor effluent from the primary contacting zone to further remove impurities and achieve a desired purity of purified gas exiting the secondary absorption zone .
the apparatuses are therefore especially beneficial in offshore applications where they are subjected to rocking .
the apparatuses and methods of vapor and liquid contacting described herein may be used in any vapor liquid contacting application , and especially offshore applications , for example , when installed on a floating vessel or platform .
