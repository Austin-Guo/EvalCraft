an electrode system to capture bioelectric signals from a subject generally should address various requirements including safety needs , cost , power consumption , performance , ease of use and subject comfort .
however , the relative importance of these factors may be somewhat different in a non clinical application than in a clinical application .
as a result , signal noise becomes more likely , and the analysis of the signals from the electrodes becomes more prone to error .
thus , the display effective acts as a feedback mechanism to inform the inexperienced user of incorrect positioning of the electrodes .
