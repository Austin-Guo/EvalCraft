the present invention provides an ink jet printer having high resolution and image quality , low power consumption , low cost and containing line heads .
the following described embodiments are preferred working examples of the invention and so are preferably limited in regards to their technical aspects , however unless otherwise stated , the scope of the invention is not limited by the following description and not limited by these aspects of the invention .
in fig1 and fig2 an ink jet printer 100 is comprised of a line head 120 having thermal elements not shown in the drawing , as drive elements for emitting droplets of ink , and having a pnm ( pulse number modulation ) function for modulating the number of dots form the ink droplets in a recording range having a width largely equal to a paper p .
a paper ejection slot 111 for the paper p is formed in one end of the cabinet 150 , and a tray inlet / outlet 112 for the paper tray 150 is formed in the other end of the cabinet 150 .
the paper feed guide 131 is formed a level plate shape and installed with specified open gaps below the line head 120 .
the paper feed rollers 132 and 133 form a pair of rollers in mutual contact , and are installed on both sides of the paper feed guide 131 , namely on the side of the tray inlet / outlet 112 and the side of the paper ejection slot 111 .
the line feed roller 141 is formed in a roughly semicircular tubular shape and installed in proximity to the paper feed roller 132 on the tray inlet / outlet 112 side .
the paper tray 150 is formed in a box shape capable of storing a plurality of sheets of paper p for instance of a 4 size , and has a paper clamp 152 engaged with a spring 151 .
therefore , when using this type of ink jet printer 100 , the user , after turning on the power to the ink jet printer 100 , pulls out the paper tray 150 from the tray inlet / outlet 112 and presses a specified number of sheets of paper p inside the paper tray 150 .
when the sheets of paper p are pressed in , the paper clamp 152 raises up the end portion of the paper p by means of the action of the spring 151 , and presses the paper p against the line feed roller 141 .
