the present invention provides a slide guide for a press which comprises a gib structure with a spherical surface .
the gibs are formed on a frame of the press .
the spherical surface is provided with a holder or a cap to cover the spherical surface .
the surface contacts are formed between the spherical surface bodies and the gibs or between the caps and the gibs .
forming spherical contact surfaces prevents damage to the sliding surface .
this slide guide provides uniform , secure contact at a sliding surface of a press and prevents uneven contact .
the spherical surface body can be easily installed and can adapt to deformation of the slide and prevent damage to the sliding surface .
the stay 19 restricts the displacement of the left and right columns and is located approximately at the midpoint of the vertical motion of the slide 2 .
a hollow screw 15 with threads on the outer perimeter screws into a screw hole of gib holder 14 .
spherical surface body 7 forms a section of a sphere and is disposed on the slide 2 .
