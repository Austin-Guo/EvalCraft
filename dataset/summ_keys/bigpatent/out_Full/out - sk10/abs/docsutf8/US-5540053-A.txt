an actuating unit for a hydraulic brake system for automotive vehicles includes a vacuum brake power booster and a master brake cylinder .
to transmit the reaction forces , developing during actuation in the master brake cylinder , to a vehicle body wall which carries the actuating unit , a centrally positioned force transmitting element is provided , which is arranged between the master brake cylinder and the vehicle body wall in terms of effect .
the force transmitting element is formed of a continuous bolt which extends in an axial direction through the control housing of the vacuum brake power booster .
the actuating unit according to the present invention , as shown in fig1 includes a vacuum brake power booster 1 and a master brake cylinder 2 , which is preferably a tandem type master cylinder , inserted after the vacuum brake power booster .
on the end remote from the input member 4 the control housing 8 supports a movable wall 5 which is formed by a diaphragm plate 22 and a rolling diaphragm 23 being in abutment against it .
valve piston 15 is guided on a continuous and centrally positioned force transmitting bolt 14 and is in force transmitting connection with the input member 4 .
valve piston 15 has a resetting movement which is limited by a transverse member 17 being , in a release position , in axial abutment against a sliding ring seal .
the sleeve shaped valve piston 15 is in force transmitting connection with an elastic reaction disc 13 , which preferably has an annular design .
valve piston 15 is positioned in a cylindrical recess of the control housing 8 and allows the transmission of the actuating force introduced at the input member 4 , on the one hand , and also of the boosting force generated by the movable wall 5 onto a pressure plate 26 , on the other hand , which interacts with a master brake cylinder piston 29 .
the other end of the force transmitting bolt 14 is anchored to the pedal assembly 44 .
