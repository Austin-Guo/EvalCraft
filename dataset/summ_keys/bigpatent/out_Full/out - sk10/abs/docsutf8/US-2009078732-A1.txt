this is a device where one component is a member which , without recourse to any tools , can be attached to or removed from a tow ball that is anchored to or integral with a tow bar .
the member is rigidly located and unable to move in any plane or about any axis when it is engaged with the tow ball and the remainder of the device .
the member has an integral platform that can be used to support and or tow any desired object e .
bicycles on a rack attached to the platform .
the part of the tow bar 1 that joins to the back of the associated vehicle ( not depicted ) is drawn as ragged to distinguish it from the free end which is furthest from the back of the vehicle and has a rounded outline .
in the following description the term “ front ” applies to being nearer to the vehicle and the term “ rear ” applies to being further away from the vehicle to which the tow bar 1 is attached .
the bottom face of the anchoring plate 9 is flat to engage the flat upper face of the tow bar 1 .
the rear of the anchoring plate 9 is shaped to lie within the outline of the rear of the tow bar 1 .
the dimensions of anchoring plate 9 are therefore set to ensure that when holes 8 and 2 align the front edge of anchoring plate 9 does not extend forward of the place , if any , where the tow bar 1 starts to bend upward .
if this requirement is not met the flat anchoring plate 9 is distorted when the securing nut 7 is tightened and the flange 4 acts to bend the anchoring plate 9 into a contour that matches the angled section of the tow bar 1 .
