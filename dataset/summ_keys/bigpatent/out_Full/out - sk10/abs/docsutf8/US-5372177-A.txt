a method and an apparatus are provided which allows the safe and inexpensive extinguishing and cooling of flaming wax emanating from an investment casting flash fire dewaxing furnace .
investment mold structures are disposed within individual cups which direct flaming wax material downwardly through individual openings in the furnace floor .
flaming wax is then extinguished within an extinguishing chamber by a stream of non aqueous inert gas .
the process makes flash fire dewaxing of investment mold structures efficient and safe and provides for easy recycling and reuse of the wax because it is not contaminated with water or other contaminant materials .
the invention is a flash fire furnace 10 useful for dewaxing an investment casting ceramic mold structure 12 .
the invention is useful in flash fire dewaxing a ceramic investment casting mold structure 12 .
the heatable furnace chamber 14 is a typical heatable furnace chamber having heat resistant walls 28 , floor 30 and a source of heat energy .
in a typical embodiment , the walls 28 and the floor 30 of the furnace 14 are constructed of steel which is heat protected by appropriate thicknesses of refractory .
in a typical embodiment , the source of heat energy is one or more gas fired primary burners 32 mounted into the side walls 28 of the furnace chamber 14 .
this configuration allows the removal of processed mold structures 12 and the installation of unprocessed mold structures 12 outside of the furnace chamber 14 so that the furnace chamber 14 can be continuously maintained at processing temperatures .
