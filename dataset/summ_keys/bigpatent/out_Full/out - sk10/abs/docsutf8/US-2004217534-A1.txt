this invention relates to a method and apparatus for producing a pillowless booklet by flattening the spine of the booklet .
with reference first to fig1 there is illustrated one preferred embodiment for use of the concepts of this invention .
upper bundle plane 26 , preferably , is constructed of any suitable , durable material that is capable of allowing the bundle to be held upon upper bundle plane 26 and traverse along upper bundle plane 26 .
clamping jaws 32 , preferably , are constructed of any suitable , durable , rigid material that is capable of clamping the bundle in order to retain the spine of the bundle .
carriage centering rollers 34 , preferably , are any suitable rollers that are capable of traversing spine form roller 38 along the spine of the bundle .
spine form roller 38 , preferably , is any suitable v shaped roller that is capable of traversing along the spine of the bundle in order to flatten the spine .
carriage drive screw 40 and drive nut 42 , preferably , can be any conventional drive screw and drive nut that are capable of driving spine form roller 38 along the spine of the bundle .
fig2 more clearly shows how the various elements interact with each other .
it is to be understood that media 3 can be any suitable media upon which printing or other similar types of imaging can be placed .
as shown in fig3 bundle clamp 5 is conventionally moved to a downward or closed position to allow media 3 to come into contact with drive rollers 10 .
