an vacuum bag for forming of a fiber reinforced composite article , made of a curable elastomer , having molded in resin distribution means .
optional vacuum conduits are molded into the periphery of the bag , causing the bag to be adapted to any number of mold shapes .
a multiplicity of cross channels are formed on the inner surface of the bag , covering most of the area under which the fiber lay up is placed within the mold .
these cross channels can be formed from a pattern of multiple , variegated small dots or pentagons , which , under vacuum , leave a multiplicity of small crisscross channels running along the inner surface of the vacuum bag .
in side view in fig1 i show a dry lay up for manufacture of a fiber composite structure 1 , utilizing the inventive vacuum bag 4 .
the composite 1 is formed on a rigid mold 6 , for this illustrative purpose a flat smooth table surface forming a backing for the fiber composite article 1 .
the shape of the mold 6 determines the shape of the final structure 1 , and thus the mold 6 can be curved or of any desired shape , as will be illustrated below .
a resin entrance chamber would be centrally placed on the lay up with a communicating resin distribution chamber to communicate resin flow to the distribution layer .
the vacuum both draws the resin throughout the fiber lay up , and presses the resin impregnated lay up against the rigid mold to smoothly form the desired fiber reinforced shape .
it should be appreciated that this process requires individual labor to set up the same distribution layers , chambers and vacuum bag in separate steps , even though identical articles may be desired .
