an intramedullary pin for insertion into the medullary space of the femur through the lateral compacta of the trochanter major .
the pin has a proximal pin section and an adjoining distal pin section .
each pin section includes one or more bores for one or more bone screws .
the proximal pin section has at least one bore running obliquely to the longitudinal axis , so that bone screws can be inserted through the bore into the head of the femur , or a screw can be inserted in the antegrade direction through the bore .
the distal pin section is at least partly straight and the proximal pin section has a curvature in the lateral posterior direction .
the shaft of the pin 1 is generally cylindrical in shape .
the proximal end 14 may be curved in a lateral posterior direction , while the distal end 15 may be straight or at least partly straight .
the length of the distal straight section may correspond to the depth to which the distal pin end penetrates into the distal spongiosa structure .
a lateral opening 2 for the intramedullary pin approximately coincides with the insertion direction of the antegrade screw .
if only one screw is set proximally , no further skin incision is therefore necessary .
