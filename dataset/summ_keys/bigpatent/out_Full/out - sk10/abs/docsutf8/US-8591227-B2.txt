a mouthpiece that adjusts manually to accommodate a broad range of different size sets of upper and lower teeth in the mouth and yet seals the treatment area from oxygen exposure .
the mouthpiece includes light emitting diodes and heat generating resistors all arranged in an array .
a series of parallel texture bands are provides to guide and direct the light from the leds to diffuse generally evenly onto teeth to be treated .
the seal arises from an inner surface of the mouthpiece titling inwardly so that a seal bead seals in the vicinity of the gum above the teeth to be treated .
during a teeth whitening treatment in a dental office , a whitening gel is applied to the teeth and a protective barrier is placed on the gums , the mucosa and lips to prevent burning of the tissues by the high concentration of hydrogen peroxide in the whitening gel .
a leading edge of the whitening gel is placed on a tooth surface .
an led based white light is placed a few inches from a tooth surface to help activate free radical oxygen , most of which becomes lost into the air .
in this invention , the mouthpiece seals or encloses a photosensitive agent , such as carbamide or hydrogen peroxide gel , to prevent the loss of the active electrons of the photosensitive agent ( carbamide or hydrogen peroxide ) into the air .
the mouthpiece holds led based white light sources and alternating heat resistors .
a power source , which may be remote from the mouthpiece , is in electrical connection with the led based white light sources and heat resistors via a wire .
