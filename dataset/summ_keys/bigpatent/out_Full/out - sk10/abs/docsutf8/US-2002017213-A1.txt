a method of printing on a substrate is disclosed .
the method includes depositing an ink on a membrane , placing the membrane in juxtaposition to the surface of the substrate and applying heat and pressure to produce a high quality color control image on the substrate .
the ink preferably comprises a thermal transfer dye , a thermal transfer pigment , a protective polymer and a carrier .
the substrate 10 may be made of any suitable material such as metal , plastic , wood or the like .
the substrate 10 may be substantially planar as shown in fig1 or may be provided with any desired contour .
for medium and high energy dyes , the temperature being a function of the amount of pressure and time and the micronization of ingredients in the inks .
the thermal transfer dye component of the ink may comprise azo , amino , anthraquinone or other disperse dyes .
other suitable transfer dyes are commercially available from gants under the designation disperse dyes , and from coates under the designation disperse dyes .
the thermal transfer dyes are preferably chosen according to color , molecular weight and dye strength .
the thermal transfer pigment component of the ink may comprise single or multiple pigment systems .
