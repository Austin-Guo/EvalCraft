the first member is an outer tube shaped sheath which is radially expandable by being formed from elastic material or other means and having relatively low column strength .
the second member is an inner portion extending throughout the outer tube .
using the structure diagnostic , therapeutic , or other desired objects may be conveyed through the device yet still enable the device to have a smaller cross sectional area throughout most of its length than the object conveyed therethrough .
our invention concerns the use of a radially expandable tubular element in the construction of medical devices containing tubular components and / or channels .
in particular , our invention concerns the use of the tubular elements in the construction of device components and channels that function to conduct or convey medical instruments and / or guidewires therethrough .
the use of radially expandable tubular elements in the construction of delivery catheters enables their manufacture with lower composite profiles relative to prior art device delivery catheters of comparable delivery capacity .
the luminal profile of shaft section 7 is sufficient to accommodate the profile of the largest device intended for delivery therethrough .
this circumstance enables the construction of shaft sections 5 and 6 with lower external profiles relative to shaft section 7 .
the shaft of the device contains at least two layers ; an inner relatively inelastic layer and an outer relatively elastic layer .
in the preferred embodiment , a lubricous coating is applied to the outer layer to facilitate the introduction and withdrawal of the device within the confines of the body .
