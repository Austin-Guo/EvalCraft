an apparatus removes liquid from a liquid and solids mixture .
the apparatus may include a bowl shaped , rigid container having an upper portion , a lower portion , and a sidewall forming a chamber for receiving the liquid and solids mixture .
the container includes a plurality of conduits extending radially outwardly along an inner portion of the sidewall .
means is also provided for reducing pressure in the chamber , which causes at least liquid to be drawn from the mixture through the filter and conduits .
related systems and methods may be follow from use of the apparatus .
fig1 a 1 d depict one aspect of the invention , which includes at least one low profile , relatively compact bowl shaped container 10 for use at an industrial site that produces a waste product , such as sludge .
the container 10 may be buried in the ground or , alternatively , may be above ground and associated with a suitable support structure , if necessary , to ensure stability .
as noted above , the container 10 is bowl shaped , upstanding and preferably generally hemispherical with an open compartment or chamber 12 for receiving the product to be dried ( i .
in a preferred embodiment of the invention , the chamber 12 is open at the top , and has a diameter of about ten feet or less .
the container 10 can be made of any suitably strong material resistant to leaking and to reaction with the corresponding product .
