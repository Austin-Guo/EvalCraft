a catheter for facilitating intracardiac atrial defibrillation that includes an elongated flexible member that has a proximal end and a distal end is disclosed .
three spaced apart electrode arrays are secured around the periphery of the flexible member in a predetermined pattern so that a first electrode array is positioned within the superior vena cava , a second electrode array is positioned within the right atrium , and a third electrode array is positioned within the coronary sinus .
alternatively , the third electrode array may be positioned in the right ventricle rather than the coronary sinus .
electrical leads extend through the proximal end of the flexible member to supply electrical current to the electrode arrays , thereby defibrillating or cardioverting the heart .
in other embodiments , a balloon envelope is also secured to the periphery of the flexible member adjacent the distal end .
referring now to the drawings in detail wherein like reference numerals have been used throughout the various figures to designate like elements , there is shown in fig1 a catheter constructed in accordance with the principles of the present invention and designated generally as 10 .
as should be readily apparent to those skilled in the art , only the working portion of the catheter 10 is shown in the drawings .
electrical wires ( not shown ) from the electrode arrays pass through the interior of the flexible member 12 to a manifold secured to the remote end of the flexible member 12 for connecting the catheter 10 to appropriate electronic equipment .
located adjacent the proximal end 14 is the first electrode array .
the array includes approximately ten electrodes 18 a 18 j where each electrode has an approximate length of five millimeters and each electrode is spaced approximately five millimeters away from each adjacent electrode .
