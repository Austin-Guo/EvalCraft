an injection molding device , which has an injection unit 3 which produces plastic melt in conventional manner and injects it into an injection molding die 6 , can be seen in fig1 .
the plastic melt is thus injected from the injection unit 3 into the die 6 along a melt flow path 4 through a machine nozzle .
