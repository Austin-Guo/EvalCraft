water is used during the application of microwave energy to enhance the absorption of microwave energy and hence heating of the filter .
this causes the carboxylic acid ester of polyol to very rapidly disperse causing it to permeate into the acetate fiber to rapidly complete the stabilization and solidification of the filter .
