a brake cylinder maintaining system that combines a brake cylinder maintaining check valve and a quick service limiting valve into a single unit to have lower hysteresis , and thus more precise bcm regulation pressure and a smaller pressure offset .
the check valve and quick service valve are coupled to provide a single system having multiple valve seats for selective communication between quick service pressure and brake cylinder pressure on one hand , and between a brake cylinder maintaining pressure and brake cylinder pressure on the other hand .
