an additive manufacturing process performed by an additive manufacturing machine includes strain gauges that detect stress within a part during fabrication within a defined workspace .
when the detected stress is exceeds a desired level the fabrication steps are paused and a stress relieving process is performed within the chamber without moving the part .
