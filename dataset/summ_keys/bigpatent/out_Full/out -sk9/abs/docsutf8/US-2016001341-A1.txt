a method for producing a torsional profile from a tubular hollow profile , the torsional profile being provided , over its entire length , with spaced apart walls , is provided .
the method includes placing the tubular hollow profile into a first deformation die , positioning the ends of the tubular hollow profile in the first deformation die by means of in each case one tapering first mandrel which extends into a torsional region , positioning the tubular hollow profile over its longitudinal extent in the first deformation die , deforming the tubular hollow profile over its longitudinal extent in the torsional region by means of a first punch , with a reduction in the tube cross sectional area in the torsional region , and removing the first punch and the first mandrels .
fig1 to 9 are different illustrations showing the production of an exemplary embodiment of a torsional profile according to the invention by means of the method according to the invention for producing a torsional profile from a tubular hollow profile 1 .
in this exemplary embodiment , the tubular hollow body 1 has a circular cross section , such that the walls of the tubular hollow profile 1 have an initial spacing d 1 .
in the cross sectional illustration as per fig4 , it can now be seen that the tubular hollow profile 1 , before its deformation , has been placed into the deformation die 2 which is in the form of a bottom die , said tubular hollow profile being securely fixed over its longitudinal extent by the readjusting guide elements 14 , which are also simultaneously designed as holders , in the deformation die 2 over its entire longitudinal extent .
fig4 furthermore illustrates a punch 6 by means of which the tubular hollow profile 1 is subsequently deformed by virtue of the punch being pushed downward into the deformation die 2 .
fig7 now shows , in a plan view , a sub region of a device for producing a torsional profile according to the invention , wherein , however , to better illustrate the cross section of the tubular hollow profile , only one half has been illustrated .
it is possible here to clearly see the holding down elements 14 which , in this exemplary embodiment , extend over the longitudinal extent of the entire tubular hollow body 1 .
in this case , the first mandrels 4 and 5 have a considerably smaller thickness in the region of the torsional region 3 than in the end region 19 of the reshaped hollow profile 7 .
