a multi spindle fiber pay out apparatus is provided that allows for fiber tension control .
the spindle is in rotational supporting relation to the spool of fiber and is operatively engaged with a magnetic particle brake , which is itself in control communication with an electronic controller .
a fiber take up system is mounted upon the frame in cooperative relation to the spool of fiber and is arranged so as to compensate for changes in the fiber pay out rate from the spool of fiber that are caused by activation / deactivation of the magnetic particle brake .
a load cell transducer is mounted on the frame adjacent to the fiber take up system .
a method is also provided for monitoring and adjusting the length of a fiber via monitoring of the tension in the fiber .
this description of preferred embodiments is intended to be read in connection with the accompanying drawings , which are to be considered part of the entire written description of this invention .
the drawing figures are not necessarily to scale and certain features of the invention may be shown exaggerated in scale or in somewhat schematic form in the interest of clarity and conciseness .
should be construed to refer to the orientation as then described or as shown in the drawing figure under discussion .
these relative terms are for convenience of description and normally are not intended to require a particular orientation .
