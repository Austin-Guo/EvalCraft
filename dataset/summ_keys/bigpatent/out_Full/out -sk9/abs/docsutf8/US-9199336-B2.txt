the invention relates to a method for allocation of a pipe or several pipes with several pipe parts to be cut for a laser cutting installation , wherein the pipe parts to be cut are selected from an order table .
fig5 shows the individual method steps s 21 to s 33 of a method for optimizing the allocation of a pipe with several pipe parts to be cut in the form of a flow chart .
the first process stage is performed prior to measurement of the length and the second process stage is performed after the measurement of the length of the pipe .
in a first step s 21 , a parts order for a pipe part to be cut is created and approved in the order table 49 of the fmc software 39 , wherein the parts order also states the quantity of the pipe parts to be cut in addition to the program name of the associated nc parts program .
when the nc parts programs of the pipe part that are required for creating a parts order are not contained in the program management 41 of the control computer 31 , the nc parts programs are imported into the program management 41 when the parts order is created .
in a second step s 22 , it is checked whether nesting of this pipe part with respect to the other pipe parts of the order table with the status “ approved ” and with respect to the same pipe part was performed and whether the nesting results are already present .
whether and to what extent a pipe part can be rotated and / or displaced is determined by the programmer via the properties “ rotatable about a offset ” and “ displaceable about x offset ” while creating the nc parts program .
for pipes having a weld seam in the longitudinal direction .
when the longitudinal seam of all cut pipe parts shall have the same orientation , the pipe parts must not be rotated relative to one another during pipe allocation and the pipe parts are non rotatable .
