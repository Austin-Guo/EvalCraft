a surgical clip applier for use in closing wounds under the microscope in small blood vessels modifies a well known clip applier system to make more steady and reliable the application of very small clips during surgery on a scale of vessel size of 2 mm in external diameter and smaller .
the known device is modified internally so as to be capable of receiving a flexible remote actuation device which can be a cable release such as used for a camera shutter , or which can be a flexible hydraulic or pneumatic line as a force transmitting device .
thus , the surgeon can hold the clip applier very steadily at the site desired without contracting any intrinsic muscles while the cable release is depressed by another person , or with the surgeon & # 39 ; s other hand , or with a foot pedal .
this clip applier is described above and is effective to dispense and apply a small clip ( clips not shown ) for closure of tissues in microsurgery , from a tip 12 of a stem 14 , extending from a handle 16 that the surgeon holds in the hand .
as illustrated , the elongated stem 14 is much narrower than the elongated gripping handle 16 and rigidly projects forward from a forward end of the handle 16 .
a pair of thumb / finger wings 18 are squeezed together by the surgeon when the tip has been correctly placed and a clip is to be applied .
shortcomings of this device are described above , particularly for microsurgery on blood vessels under 2 mm or other very small surgical sites , the clip placement being performed under the microscope ; and for endoscopic surgery or other use in narrow , difficult areas .
the clip applier 10 has a rotation wheel 20 to enable the surgeon to adjust the rotational orientation of the stem 14 to any desired direction .
fig2 , again showing the prior art clip applier 10 , reveals the important internal components which effect clip dispensing and with which the invention is concerned .
