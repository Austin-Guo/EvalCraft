a shipping container assembly for securing and stabilizing a load for truck transportation using recyclable components .
the container assembly includes multiple support structures positioned about the load with oppositely disposed end cap assemblies to stabilize and protect the load which is comprises of multiple elongated units .
referring to fig1 of the drawings , a shipping container assembly 10 of the invention can be seen having a pair of intermediate support structures 11 and oppositely disposed end cap assemblies 12 .
the honeycomb base pads 13 have a honeycomb center of interconnected cellulose bands 16 on edge between upper and lower encasement paper skins 18 as will be well understood by those skilled in the art .
as such , the base pads 13 provide a raised insulated surface for a load l illustrated in fig7 of the drawings .
the overlying connecting elements 15 are made from a multiple layer of cardboard sheets of longitudinal flute construction having oppositely disposed right angular flaps 19 and 20 each of which is cut inwardly from its respective free ends to define bendable tabs 21 and 22 on each of said flaps .
referring now to fig2 5 of the drawings , it will be seen that to assemble each of the intermediate support structures 11 first a connector element 15 is positioned flange side up on a flat surface .
next the panel base 13 is positioned thereon and pairs of the supporting tubes 14 extend in oppositely disposed relationship between respective free ends of the panel base 13 and upstanding flanges 19 and 20 .
a second connecting element 15 extends over the upstanding free ends of the support tubes 14 interconnecting same about the load l .
