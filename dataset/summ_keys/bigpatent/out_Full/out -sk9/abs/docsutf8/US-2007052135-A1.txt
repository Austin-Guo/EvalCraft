the present invention relates to a magnetic articulated sliding undercut mechanism for use with an apparatus for forming a plastic article from a sheet of plastic material heated to a predetermined forming temperature .
the magnets are situated below the sliding undercut and , along with the stripper plate mechanism , help return the sliding undercut mechanism to its starting position after the thermoforming process has been completed .
the use of the magnets also allows the sliding undercut mechanism to set itself in the same position every time it returns back to its molding or relaxed position .
the sliding undercut mechanisms 13 are preferably stainless steel , but could be comprised of another metal material .
for the purposes of this invention , the magnets 16 used were rare earth magnets .
the coupling means 17 preferably are aluminum or steel material , however the coupling means 17 may be comprised of any metal , metal alloy , or nonmetal that would provide rigid structural support .
the second mold section 21 is moved along a forming axis , designated in fig2 as a , in one direction toward the first mold section 10 for urging at least a portion of the heated plastic sheet 26 into the forming cavity 11 of the first mold section 10 to form the plastic article 25 while the undercut forming element 18 is in the forming position .
the thermoplastic material is initially extruded into sheet form and is then fed into a heating station ( not shown ) where it is heated to the desired forming temperature .
while not shown in the drawings , conventional means are provided for moving the first mold section 10 and the second mold section 21 toward and away from one another along an axial path designated in fig2 as forming axis a .
