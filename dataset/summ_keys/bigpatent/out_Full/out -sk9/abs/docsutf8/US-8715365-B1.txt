the invention discloses a surgical technique and apparatus for minimally invasive replacement of a fractured femoral head in hip arthroscopy .
the fractured femoral head is first removed from the patient , and an incision made on the patient on a lateral aspect of the operative thigh .
a hole is then drilled into the cortex of the operative femur of the patient through the incision .
the femoral neck and femoral canal of the operative femur are reamed by inserting a reamer through the drilled hole .
a hip prosthesis is then inserted into the wound and injected with molding .
the hip prosthesis includes a femoral component having a distal end and a proximal end , the distal end inserted and anchored in the reamed femoral canal , and a femoral head component with smooth surface .
the femoral head component contains a deflated balloon that , when inflated with molding , is similar to a neo femoral head .
in the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments , reference is made to the accompanying drawings , which form a part thereof , and within which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments by which the invention may be practiced .
it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the invention .
