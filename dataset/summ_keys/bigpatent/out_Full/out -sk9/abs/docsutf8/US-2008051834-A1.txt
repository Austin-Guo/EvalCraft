a high strength surgical suture formed of ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene yarns , the suture being coated with native or denatured collagen .
the braided jacket surrounds a core formed of twisted yarns of ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene .
the suture has exceptional strength , is ideally suited for most orthopedic procedures , and can be attached to a suture anchor or a curved needle .
referring to fig1 , a scanning electron micrograph of a length of suture 2 according to the present invention is shown .
due to the transparent nature of the uhmwpe , the suture takes on the color of strands 10 and 12 , and thus appears to be white with a trace in the contrasting color .
in accordance with the present invention , trace strands 12 are preferably provided in black .
the black trace assists surgeons in distinguishing between suture lengths with the trace and suture lengths without the trace .
traces also assist the surgeon in identifying whether the suture is moving .
the trace can extend the entire length of the suture or only on half of a length of suture , the other half of the suture length remaining plain ( white ) .
