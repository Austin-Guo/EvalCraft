an apparatus for mounting a mold box on a machine for forming molded concrete products includes a mold defining a cavity for receiving cement having a pair of opposed side plates and a pair of opposed mounting brackets .
a mold support frame is further included having a pair of opposed side beams and a pair of opposed end brackets , with a connecting device for mounting the support frame on the machine .
a pair of opposed substantially parallel slots is formed on the support frame side beams and a sliding plate is receivable in the slots and slidable therealong .
a slot is also formed on one of the mold mounting brackets , such that the sliding plate is receivable in the slot formed on the mold mounting bracket .
the spaces between partition plates , such as plates 26 , 28 , provide cavities into which wet cement is compressed and thereafter stripped therefrom to form a molded concrete product .
an alignment pin , such as pin 58 shown in fig2 is mounted on the end bracket at each corner portion and an alignment bore , such as bore 60 , coaxial with the pin , is formed on the side beam .
the bores are sized and positioned so that , when each bore has its associated alignment pin therein , the mold box support frame is sufficiently aligned to form molded products , all as more fully described in my u .
the other retractor , not visible in the drawings , is located at the opposite end of mold box assembly 10 and is substantially identical to retractor 90 .
retractor 90 further includes an associated bolt 98 , which is threaded adjacent its end so as to engage spacer 66 when the bolt is fully extended through the bores .
