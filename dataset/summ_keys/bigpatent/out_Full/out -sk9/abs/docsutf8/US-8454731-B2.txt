vapor liquid contacting apparatuses comprising a primary contacting zone and a secondary contacting zone are disclosed .
a representative secondary contacting zone is a secondary absorption zone , such as a finishing zone for subsequent contacting of the vapor effluent from the primary contacting zone to further remove impurities and achieve a desired purity of purified gas exiting the secondary absorption zone .
the apparatuses are therefore especially beneficial in offshore applications where they are subjected to rocking .
the apparatuses and methods of vapor and liquid contacting described herein may be used in any vapor liquid contacting application , and especially offshore applications , for example , when installed on a floating vessel or platform .
in such cases , vapor liquid contacting is susceptible to inefficiencies resulting from horizontal motion of the apparatus ( e .
improved contacting efficiency and associated performance gains are achieved by better protecting the secondary contacting zone against the effects of horizontal movement , in particular by disposing this zone at a height below the primary contacting zone .
, such that they do not require an excessive installation surface on a floating vessel or platform ) .
the primary absorption zone 100 is in the form of an upper absorption column and comprises , for example packing material or a plurality of trays to improve the efficiency of vapor liquid contacting in this zone .
otherwise , separate vessels may be used to contain the different absorption zones .
