a power driven socket holding ratchet wrench which has a socket made so that it has a central opening that may be used for receiving a long stud or member , which passes through the socket .
the wrench acts much like a box end wrench .
the wrench is made so that it can be relatively compact in axial height , that is , along the length of the sprocket and the frame is small in diameter relative to the socket size to permit it to fit into tight places .
the power drive is capable of being positioned at an angle relative to the wrench head , and the wrench includes a unique ratcheting and quick release mechanism that facilitates the operation of the unit .
the ball also will slide axially a limited amount along the axis of the pin , as well as being able to rotate on the crank pin .
also shown in fig3 are a pair of detent members indicated generally at 38 , which are spring loaded , slidable members 38a that have points that bear against the end surfaces of the support portion 26 of the frame 21 .
the support portions 26 can have small dimples or recesses 38b therein into which the end portions of members 38a will fit .
for example one such position is shown in fig4 and the other position can be at an opposite direction incline , as well as generally perpendicular to the axis of the socket .
the plates 23 and 24 are spaced apart in direction along the axis of the socket used and together form a mounting assembly .
