the present invention provides such a spherical block structure wherein each spherical block is made up of three intersecting rings corresponding to the three axes of the sphere .
the spherical block structure created by the intersecting rings results in a hollow center with eight cavities radiating outward , the cavities providing a location for the disposition of a connection means whereby individual spherical blocks may be releasably connected to form larger structures .
the spherical building block of the present invention is derived from a cube and is , itself , the product of a plurality of squares folded and assembled to form the individual subunits that are joined together to form the intersecting rings .
to permit eight of the subunits 4 to combine to form a ring 9 , the fitting angles 6 have to be adjusted to an external angle of 45 degrees , which obliges the exterior lid or upper surface 7 to adopt a semispherical curvature while the interior lid or lower surface 8 remains flat .
this procedure is so simple since the nature of the square contains in its proportion the capacity to form spheres , or substantially spherical bodies 1 .
it is the exact relation between the side and the diagonal , what allows the thirtysix squares to form a union system that is perfectly symmetrical and exact .
which describes a surface scheme based on the similar principal of eighteen squares to form a sphere .
these six intersection subunits are called x ( fig1 a ) because the letter represents the crossing of the two directions .
when accommodating the subunits in three circles you are assuring that each ring 9 will have an identical circumference c1 and you can perfectly define the eight octants .
