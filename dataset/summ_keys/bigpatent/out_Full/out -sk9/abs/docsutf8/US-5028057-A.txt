a device on hand machine tools is suggested for the transmission of torque to percussion drilling tools in which at least two rotary driving grooves open out at the end of the tool shaft and strip shaped rotary drivers of the tool shaft engage in these rotary driving grooves and include assigned flanks , which are at least approximately planar , and in which locking members are arranged in the tool receptacle and cooperate with two recesses in the tool shaft which are closed on both sides and lie diametrically opposite one another .
in order to avoid incorrectly reversed insertion of tools with driving grooves which are worn out due to intensive wear , the latter are distributed along the circumference of the tool shaft in such a way that two rotary driving grooves can in no case lie diametrically opposite one another .
a tool spindle 2 extends out of the end of the housing of a drill hammer 1 , which end is on the side of the workpiece and is only shown in part .
the tool spindle 2 transmits a torque on the one hand and axial strokes , on the other hand , to a tool receptacle 3 which is securely connected with it .
two recesses 7 which are closed in the axial direction at both sides are arranged at the tool shaft 5 so as to be located opposite one another on a diagonal line ; assigned locking bodies 8 of the tool holder 3 are constructed as balls to engage in the recesses 7 .
as can be seen in fig2 the slot or groove like recesses 7 have a circular cylindrical cross sectional shape .
as can be seen in fig2 the rotary driving grooves 9 are situated so as to be offset at different angles relative to the recesses 7 .
the rotary driving grooves 9 have two planar flanks 10 which extend at least approximately radially and cooperate with assigned surfaces of strip shaped rotary drivers 11 which are arranged at the cylindrical inner wall of the receptacle bore hole 4 of the tool receptacle 3 .
the front portion of the drill 6 located in the front of the tool shaft 5 is constructed in a conventional manner , a view of the latter being omitted in the drawing for this reason .
