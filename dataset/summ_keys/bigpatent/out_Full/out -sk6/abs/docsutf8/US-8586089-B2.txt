improved compositions for tissue augmentation are provided .
these compositions comprise an amount of crosslinked material sufficient to provide a melt temperature greater than 37c , wherein microparticles can be substantially uniformly dispersed and maintained at ambient room temperature as well as body temperature .
said compositions also provide high shear moduli , sufficient to effectively deliver microparticles into dense tissue and narrow intersticial spaces without significant disruption to the homogeneous distribution of microparticles within the solution .
the provided compositions can be stored and shipped at room temperature without significant detriment to the material composition .
additional embodiments include a system for delivery of tissue augmentation materials and methods of manufacture thereof .
although the disclosure herein refers to certain described embodiments , it is to be understood that embodiments presented herein are by way of example and not by way of limitation .
