a process of separating husks from dried spent grains comprising the steps of subjecting dried a spent grains produced in a malting operation to a low temperature to embrittle the grains and then exerting mechanical force on the embrittled grains to separate the husks from the grains .
as the source of enzymes for mashing , and because of its decisive influence on the characteristic taste of beer , barley malt is the one indespensable brewing material .
malting is simply the controlled germination of grain , the germination being stopped at a desired stage by means of heat .
the purpose of malting the barley is to develop the dormant enzymes of the barley so that they can break down the carbohydrates and release the fermentable sugars .
the cycle is normally divided into steps to allow various enzymes to act at the temperatures best suited to such actions .
one of the reasons for using barley is that the structure of the barley husks makes the bed of spent barley grains especially suitable as a filter .
