a method includes creating a lookup table for thermal correction of a x ray detector on a pixel by pixel basis .
there are herein described methods and apparatus useful for imaging systems such as , for example , but not limited to an x ray system .
the apparatus and methods are illustrated with reference to the figures wherein similar numbers indicate the same elements in all figures .
such figures are intended to be illustrative rather than limiting and are included herewith to facilitate explanation of an exemplary embodiment of the apparatus and methods of the invention .
in this disclosure , methods and apparatus are described that will enable the measurement of the absolute temperature seen by each pixel in an array of diodes used in a multislice ct detector .
the measurement setup can however be extended to any diode system .
