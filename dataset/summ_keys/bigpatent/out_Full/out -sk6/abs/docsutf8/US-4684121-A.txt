an exercise device for simulating several outdoor sports is made portable and convenient by using a rectangular frame with parallel rails and two roller members which can move independently along the rails to simulate skiing or together as a rowing seat and handle members cooperate with the respective exercise .
the present invention relates to an exercise kit for use indoors to simulate the exercise and develop the muscles used in participation in cross country skiing outdoors and rowing .
the kit also permits other exercises for the arms and legs .
the kit comprises a main frame 10 which is the shape of an elongate rectangle having longitudinal side members 11 and 12 , opposite end members 14 and 15 and two members 16 and 18 which extend between the end members parallel to said side members 11 and 12 and parallel to each other to define a pair of rails extending lengthwise of the frame .
attached and positioned oblique to the end member 15 is a pair of spaced foot rest pads 20 and 21 .
the spring member 25 , as illustrated , comprises a plurality of horizontally disposed helical tension springs 26 connected at one end to the end member 14 and to a bracket 27 at their other end .
