a robotic endoscope for performing endoscopic procedures in a tubular organ comprising : a plurality of segments , connected together by a plurality of flexible articulated joints , having a distal end ; a plurality of flexible linear actuators attached , skewed sideways with respect to the longitudinal axis of said robot , circumferentially round each segment ; a central cavity running longitudinally through said robotic endoscope which houses a plurality of optical fibres , a water / air hose , an instrumentation channel and a plurality of electrical wires associated with an imaging means being mounted at the distal end of the robotic endoscope ; and a network of tributary channels for the distribution of pressure to said linear actuators .
the present invention is also applicable to an autonomous pipe robot .
they are positioned skewed sideways with respect to the longitudinal axis of the body ( of the robot ) with their distal ends pointing radially away from the main body ( of the robot ) .
locomotive force is produced as the bellow ( 11 ) extends to push against the internal walls of the organ .
this collapsible mechanism is a safe guard against puncturing and perforation of the delicate walls .
the computer program will ensure that the polarity of the input voltage will cause the motor ( 80 ) to turn in the desired direction .
