fig1 shows a perspective view of an embodiment of a soft contact lens package 1 ( generally representing an ophthalmic lens package ) which is of a blister package type .
in the closed state the soft contact lens package 1 , the base part 2 and the cover film 3 are tightly bonded together along the bonding area 7 , so that neither liquid nor gases can escape from or enter into the depression 4 where the contact lens 5 immersed in the liquid 6 is stored .
the bonding area 7 is located on a portion of the flange 8 which extends outwardly from the depression 4 in a planar manner , and is located directly adjacent to the depression 4 .
such a base part 2 can be produced very reliably and is inexpensive to manufacture .
in addition , such a plastic base part 2 is suitable for thermal bonding without the need to add any additional bonding material ( glue , adhesive or the like ) before thermally bonding the cover film 3 and the base part 2 .
the ophthalmic lens 5 is placed into the depression and the liquid 6 is dispensed into the depression 4 before thermally bonding the base part 2 and the cover film 3 together .
