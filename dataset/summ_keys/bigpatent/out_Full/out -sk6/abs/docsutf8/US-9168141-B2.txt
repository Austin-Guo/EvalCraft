disclosed are medical prosthetic device or medical implants which exhibit improved biocompatibility .
, titanium , in which the metal surfaces are coated with a corresponding hydride material that contains one or more biomolecule substance .
in the present context , the phrase “ medical prosthetic device and implant ” includes within its scope any device intended to be implanted into the body of a vertebrate animal , in particular a mammal such as a human .
a non limiting list of main groups of and species biomolecules that are contemplated as being suitable for incorporation into a metal hydride layer ( in a stable and / or physiologically reversible manner ) in accordance with the invention is given below .
cell attachment factors are biomolecules that mediate attachment and spreading of cells onto biological surfaces or other cells and tissues .
this group of molecules typically contains molecules participating in cell matrix and cell cell interaction during vertebrate development , neogenesis , regeneration and repair .
