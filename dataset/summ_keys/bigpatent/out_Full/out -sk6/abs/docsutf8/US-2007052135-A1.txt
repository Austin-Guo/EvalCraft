the present invention relates to a magnetic articulated sliding undercut mechanism for use with an apparatus for forming a plastic article from a sheet of plastic material heated to a predetermined forming temperature .
the magnets are situated below the sliding undercut and , along with the stripper plate mechanism , help return the sliding undercut mechanism to its starting position after the thermoforming process has been completed .
the use of the magnets also allows the sliding undercut mechanism to set itself in the same position every time it returns back to its molding or relaxed position .
the sliding undercut mechanisms 13 are preferably stainless steel , but could be comprised of another metal material .
for the purposes of this invention , the magnets 16 used were rare earth magnets .
the coupling means 17 preferably are aluminum or steel material , however the coupling means 17 may be comprised of any metal , metal alloy , or nonmetal that would provide rigid structural support .
