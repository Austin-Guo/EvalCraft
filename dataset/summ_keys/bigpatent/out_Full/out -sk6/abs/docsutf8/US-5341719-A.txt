a multi layer composite gun barrel has an integral metal alloy jacket portion , forming the exterior cylinder of the entire barrel , with a forebarrel interior liner cylinder substantially bonded within the jacket portion , and an unbonded breech portion liner , made from a high melting temperature refractory metal alloy able to resist erosion by hot gun gases in the barrel breech area .
the jacket / liner portions are formed from a tubular coextrusion cylinder of concentric material layers carefully selected to include compatible materials , such as nickel , iron and cobalt base superalloys .
the boreliner portion 20 can be fabricated of a more expensive high density refractory metal alloy which can withstand the very high breech temperature .
25720 ) with an inco in 909 iron based alloy jacket 16 surrounding and metallurgically joined to an inco in 718 nickel based alloy liner 18 , with both the inside and outside of the tube being formed within one coextrusion die , to provide a high degree of concentricity of the interface diameter d i to both the liner bore surface 18c and the od of the jacket portion 16 .
the in 718 liner alloy has sufficiently high chromium content to offer good erosion resistance to hot gun gasses .
the in 909 jacket was selected for its low thermal expansion and good elevated temperature strength .
