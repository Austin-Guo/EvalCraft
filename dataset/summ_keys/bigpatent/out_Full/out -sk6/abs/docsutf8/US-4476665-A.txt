the packaging of plural articles in a common wrapper is accomplished with the aid of wrapping mandrels into which preformed blocks of the articles are loaded .
the wrapping mandrels have movable slides which define the effective length of the mandrels and thus insure that first ends of the articles will lie in the plane of the insertion end of the mandrels , the first ends of the articles thus defining a stable base over which a wrapping may be folded .
the slides are reciprocated in the mandrels to eject packages , open at one end , to a device for closing the open end .
with reference now to the drawing , and considering all the figures simultaneously , for purposes of explanation a cigarette packaging machine has been depicted .
the cigarettes 10 to be packaged in this machine are received on a feed belt 11 .
the cigarettes are delivered to the packaging machine in a direction transverse to their axial length and are conveyed into a pair of hoppers 12 and 13 .
