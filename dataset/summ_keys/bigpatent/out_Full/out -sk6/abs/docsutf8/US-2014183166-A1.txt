the present invention relates to a manufacturing method for advanced high strength steel wheel , comprising the following steps .
apply low heat input welding , such as the cold metal transfer welding or the gas tungsten arc welding / tungsten inert gas arc welding , at the junction of the rim to form a hollow cylindrical rim .
then perform hole expanding and spinning / roll forming operations to the rim .
apply low heat input welding , such as cold metal transfer welding , to the rim and the disk to produce a wheel .
according to the present invention , the welding quality of products can be improved significantly ; the fatigue lifetime of wheels can be enhanced ; and wheels are lightweight .
in order to make the structure and characteristics as well as the effectiveness of the present invention to be further understood and recognized , the detailed description of the present invention is provided as follows along with embodiments and accompanying figures .
