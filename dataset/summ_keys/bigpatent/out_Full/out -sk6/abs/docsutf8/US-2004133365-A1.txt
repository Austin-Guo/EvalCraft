the present invention relates to a method of determining forces and torques acting on a riding vehicle .
the invention is characterized in that measuring signals from acceleration sensors are evaluated which are fitted , preferably in longitudinal , transverse and vertical alignment , to one or more selected points on the vehicle , and that other signals are evaluated which represent the spatial angular velocity of the vehicle and its time derivative or at least some of these variables , and that a mathematic model of the vehicle is provided in which forces and torques acting on the vehicle or at least selected components of these forces and torques are determined from the sensor signals .
now referring to fig1 the offset of the center of gravity s from the vehicle center is referred to as s y , the level of the center of gravity above the roadway is designated by the letter h .
to determine the sums of tire contact forces f lz and f rz and the sum of transverse force f y , the vehicle is looked at as a rigid body in a simplified two dimensional model , onto which body only the contact forces between tire contact area and roadway act beside the gravitational force .
aerodynamic forces and the movement of vehicle parts relative to a system of coordinates ( x , y , z ) on the vehicle moved along with the vehicle body , such as the rotation and compression of the vehicle wheels , may be ignored in this context .
a rigid body moves under the effect of applied forces and torques according to generally known mathematical interrelationships , i .
