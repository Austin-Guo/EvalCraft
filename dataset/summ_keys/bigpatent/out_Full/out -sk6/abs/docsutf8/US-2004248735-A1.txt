wet proofed catalyst being a hydrophobic porous matrix with catalylically active platinum plus at least one of chromium are titanium dispersed in the matrix .
the percentage loading of each metal was varied in the test samples to investigate the effects of the actual amount and the ratio of the different metals on the substrate .
the catalyst samples were subjected to different tests to determine the activities of the catalysts .
the conditions of testing ranged in temperature and pressure under vapour phase or trickle bed mode .
unless otherwise stated , carbon black was used as the substrate for all catalysts .
with a number of exceptions , all catalyst powders comprising pt were prepared using a standard method of precipitation of pt using sodium platinum sulfite as generally described in u .
