the invention relates to a device for damping an upper suspension part in at least one spatial direction with respect to a lower suspension part movable relative thereto , wherein a spring apparatus which acts between the upper suspension part and the lower suspension part is provided for damping , wherein an actuating element is provided by way of which a force can be introduced into the device bidirectionally in the operating direction of the spring apparatus , wherein the actuating element is actuable via a control apparatus .
in the present case , the spring means 3 consists of a scissor type support apparatus 6 and of a spring 5 in the form of an air spring , by means of which movements in a vertical direction z can be damped .
in this respect the scissor type support apparatus 6 consists of a first scissors 10 and a second scissors 13 .
the first scissors 10 consists of a first inner link 7 and a first outer link 8 , these being interconnected so as to be pivotable with respect to one another approximately in the centres thereof .
the second scissors 13 consists of a second inner link 11 and a second outer link 12 , which are likewise interconnected so as to be pivotable with respect to one another approximately in the centres thereof .
the lower ends of the first inner link 7 and the second inner link 11 are arranged on a floating bearing transverse connection 24 , which is mounted in fixed bearings 25 arranged fixedly on the lower suspension face 2 .
