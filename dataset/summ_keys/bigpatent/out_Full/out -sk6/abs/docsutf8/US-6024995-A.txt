the product , formed essentially as a praline , comprises a shell which encloses a creamy filing with very low viscosity , possibly enhanced by a nut .
the shell which is coated by one or more coating layers , possibly with the addition of a sprinkled substance and decorative element , is constituted by two half shells , coupled face to face .
one of the half shells is made of a moldable fat containing substance such as chocolate , whereas the other half shell is made of wafer .
the contribution of the half shell made of a moldable substance to the weight of the shell is preferably greatly predominant in comparison with the corresponding contribution of the wafer half shell .
the invention will now be described , purely by way of non limiting example , with reference to the appended drawings comprising figures numbered from 1 to 11 which show schematically the production sequence of a product according to the invention , as well as a fig1 , which corresponds to a section taken on the line xii xii of fig1 , on a slightly enlarged scale .
although the reference to a substance such as chocolate indicates a preferred solution , it should in no way be interpreted as limiting of the scope of the invention .
