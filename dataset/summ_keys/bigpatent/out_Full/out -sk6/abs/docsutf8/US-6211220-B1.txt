a method for inhibiting neoplasia , particularly cancerous and precancerous lesions by exposing the affected cells to amino or pyridylamino cyclobutane derivatives .
particularly useful compounds in the practice of the methods of this invention include : compounds of the formula ( 1 ) may form pharmaceutically acceptable salts with acids such as hydrochloric , hydrobromic , sulphuric and phosphoric acids .
compounds of the formula ( 1 ) may form pharmaceutically acceptable sets with metal ions , such as alkali metals for example sodium and potassium , or with an ammonium ion .
the present invention is also a method of treating individuals with neoplastic lesions by administering a pharmacologically effective amount of an enterically coated pharmaceutical composition that includes compounds of this invention .
also , the present invention is a method of inhibiting the growth of neoplastic cells by exposing the cells to an effective amount of compounds of formula i , wherein r 1 , r 2 , r 3 and n are defined as above .
in still another form , the invention is a method of inducing apoptosis in human cells by exposing these cells to an effective amount of compounds of formula i , wherein r 1 , r 2 , r 3 and n are defined as above where such cells are sensitive to these compounds .
