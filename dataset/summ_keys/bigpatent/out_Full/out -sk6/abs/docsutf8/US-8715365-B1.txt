the invention discloses a surgical technique and apparatus for minimally invasive replacement of a fractured femoral head in hip arthroscopy .
the fractured femoral head is first removed from the patient , and an incision made on the patient on a lateral aspect of the operative thigh .
a hole is then drilled into the cortex of the operative femur of the patient through the incision .
the femoral neck and femoral canal of the operative femur are reamed by inserting a reamer through the drilled hole .
a hip prosthesis is then inserted into the wound and injected with molding .
the hip prosthesis includes a femoral component having a distal end and a proximal end , the distal end inserted and anchored in the reamed femoral canal , and a femoral head component with smooth surface .
