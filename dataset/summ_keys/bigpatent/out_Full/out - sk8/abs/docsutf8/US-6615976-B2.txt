a device for controlling the conveyance of particulate material on a conveyor belt comprises a frame with an endless belt attached thereto .
the apparatus is positioned above the conveyor belt and in frictional contact therewith whereby the motion of the conveyor results in motion of the endless belt on the apparatus .
the particulate material thereby is passes between the endless belt and the conveyor belt and any bouncing movement of such material is prevented .
use of the present invention on conventional conveyor belts controls the dispersion of the particulate material carried thereon and allows for the speed of the conveyor to be increased .
the present invention is suitable for use with a conveyor apparatus used with a truck and commonly known as a “ stone slinger ” .
the truck includes an endless thrower belt 12 , that is attached to the vehicle and is supported by a frame 50 .
the truck includes a drive means ( not shown ) to power the belt so as to move particulate material ( not shown ) deposited onto the belt from the truck bed 14 or from a hopper .
material may be deposited onto the belt directly from the truck bed 14 or an additional conveyor 54 may operate between the truck bed 14 and the belt 12 to transfer the material .
