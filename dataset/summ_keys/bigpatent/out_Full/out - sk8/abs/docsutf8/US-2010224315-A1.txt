a system and method of refacing or resurfacing racks , shelves , labeling surfaces and the like .
a tape having a release coating on one side is adhesively secured to the object surface .
the tape has properties that will completely mask or “ block out ” any labels or markings on the rack to provide a clean and uniform surface .
pressure sensitive labels can be placed on the exposed surface of the object .
these labels may contain indicia related to the assigned location of the object , product stored , safety information and the like .
when the status of this information changes , the label is removed and a new label may be substituted on the object .
in one embodiment , the adhesive coating 312 comprises a black adhesive that can also serve as a masking feature .
it is further noted that when the tape 100 ( or 200 ) is applied to the rack beam 402 , any pits or pockmarks on the beam are securely covered and hidden by the tape , thereby providing a clean , smooth surface upon which any suitable label ( s ) may be affixed .
