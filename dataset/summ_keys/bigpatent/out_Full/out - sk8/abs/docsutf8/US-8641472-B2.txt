in a preferred embodiment a body is employed to pivotally mount the head to the tail .
the motor unit comprises at least two independently driven wheels located towards opposite sides of the head and the motor unit is configured to introduce a periodic oscillation between the operation of the independently driven wheels .
the motor unit may also be configured to operate a tongue that extends out from the head to further increase the realistic nature of the toy .
embodiments of the snake may be adapted for use on land or water .
in a similar manner , a further nine body sections 5 are longitudinally arranged between the central body section 3 and the tail 4 , each body section 5 again being pivotally attached to their adjacent segments .
