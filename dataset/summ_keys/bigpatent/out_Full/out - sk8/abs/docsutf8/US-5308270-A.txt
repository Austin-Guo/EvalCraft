the buoy is pedo shaped with a collapsible obturator tail fin section removably attached at the tail end , standard electronics in a mid section and an explosive nose cone at the front .
immediately after launch , the tail fin section expands to exert a drag on the buoy to halt any forward motion .
the tail fin section is discarded and the nose cone and mid section portion rise until the nose impacts the underside of the ice .
referring now to the drawings , wherein like reference characters designate like or corresponding parts throughout the several views , there is illustrated in fig1 a pictorial depiction of the first stage of deployment of an ice penetrating buoy 22 as it is launched from the buoy launch tube 25 of a submarine ( not shown ) , as is normal procedure in the industry .
fig2 through 9 all show further details of the tail section and how it functions during buoy launch , then springs open to act as a large net to almost completely stop any forward motion and , finally , how it falls away when no longer needed .
fins 36 are each constructed in the general shape of an arcuate section of a circle , as can be seen in fig8 .
the silicone rubber used has a durometer of about 20 .
tail section 32 and lower electronics package 29 are also bound together by a retainer spring 48 made from spring steel wire .
