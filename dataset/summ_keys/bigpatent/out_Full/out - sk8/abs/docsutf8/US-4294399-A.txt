a folding box forming a hinged lid container especially designed for cigarettes and other smoking articles is provided with a stationary box , a rotating cap and a locking mechanism .
the rotating cap and stationary box are provided with complementary locking elements within the walls of the box to effect a locking and unlocking of the cap with an accompanying click in the release and the joinder of the locking elements .
the locking means form a part of the walls and lie in the respective planes of the walls when the cap is in the closed or open position .
fig1 discloses the principle of the present invention by showing the closure of one corner of a unitary folding cigarette box wherein stationary locking means 4 contain rotating locking means 8 in the same plane when the cap 6 is in a closed position .
these cutting lines are shown substantially linearly for the greater portion , but alternatively they could also be curved in one or the opposite direction .
alternatively they could be formed by a pair of angular or perpendicular cutting lines , e .
, by a first cutting line portion which forms a linear or angular extension of the folding line 28 and 29 respectively and a second cutting line portion extending towards the upper wall 20 .
the important feature is that the cutting lines define locking means in the planes of the walls .
