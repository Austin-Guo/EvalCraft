a power tool , which is preferably configured as a right angle grinder , has a motor driven hollow spindle to drive a tool , which is fastened between a clamping flange and a counterflange by means of a quick clamping device via a tension spindle , coaxial with the hollow spindle , that is tensioned in the axial direction by means of elastic elements and is displaceable in the axial direction relative to the hollow spindle , by means of a clamping lever , between a clamped position in which the tool is nonrotatably retained between the flanges , and a released position .
the clamping lever is mechanically coupled to the motor switch by means of a link rod in such a way that the clamping lever can be moved into the released position only when the motor is switched off .
this rules out improper operation and any potential damage to the power tool .
in fig1 an exemplary embodiment of the invention is labeled in its entirety with the number 10 .
one end of the hollow spindle 24 projects outward from the gear drive housing 12 and is configured as a counterflange 26 with which is associated an external clamping flange 28 to clamp a tool 29 located between them , which in the example shown is a grinding disk .
a quick clamping device which has a tension spindle 36 , coaxial with the hollow spindle 24 , that is joined integrally to the clamping flange 28 is provided in order to allow manual clamping and unclamping of the tool 29 .
the tension spindle 36 can be displaced in the axial direction by means of a displacement unit via a clamping lever 74 that can pivot about an axis 80 .
the pusher element 42 has internal threads 35 into which the tension spindle 36 can be threaded with external threads 33 provided at its upper end .
