crampon and snowshoe combinations are disclosed , wherein the crampon or terrain engaging cleat can be a traditional ice crampon used on a rigid and essentially unbending boot , or a soft boot cleat which engages only the front portion of the boot , forward of the heel , permitting boot flexing .
the snowshoe has in a toe or ball area a registry plate configured to engage with the crampon , preferably between depending teeth or other structure of the crampon , and preferably with a self centering feature as the crampon is lowered down onto the registry plate .
specific configurations of cleats or crampons are also disclosed , for use with or without snowshoes .
a boot 20 with an attached crampon or terrain engaging cleat 22 is secured to the snowshoe by a front harness assembly of the snowshoe , generally identified by 24 .
the decking areas 14 , 16 and 18 in this preferred embodiment are retained to the snowshoe frame 12 by sections of decking material which extend around the frame and are riveted together to the main body of decking , as at 30 , for example , and as shown in u .
as fig2 reveals , the snowshoe 10 has a front harness assembly 24 , preferably pivotable about a horizontal axis which can be provided by one or more resilient straps 32 wrapped around the frame and retaining the harness assembly preferably in a toe down biased position , as shown in u .
however , the front harness and pivot assembly is without a front claw or cleat , nor does the snowshoe have any rear cleat .
instead , the open areas 28 and 26 provide space for a user wearing a boot and a crampon such as the crampon 22 to step into the snowshoe and lock the crampon to the snowshoe , after which the teeth of the crampon can be used as front and rear cleats for the snowshoe .
