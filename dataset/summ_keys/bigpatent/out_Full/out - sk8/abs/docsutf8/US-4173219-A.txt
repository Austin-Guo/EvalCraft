disclosed is a full dental tray for use in applying a fluoride gel simultaneously to both the upper and lower teeth .
the tray is a disposable , laminated structure including a hydrophilic foam interior formed and heat bonded to a polyethylene foam substrate .
the tray has upper and lower portions which are hinged together and are contoured to properly accommodate the particular tooth structure of the posterior and anterior teeth , and the general geometry of both the upper and lower jaws .
referring to the drawings , fig1 shows the dental tray of the present invention , generally indicated at 10 , to include two u shaped portions , a lower portion 12 for treating the lower dentition and an upper portion 14 for treating the upper dentition .
the two portions are connected adjacent their posterior ends by a bridging strap 16 which forms a hinge when the tray is in use .
as best shown in fig2 each tray portion consists of an outer shell or substrate 18 , preferably made in a single piece by vacuum forming from a soft polyethlene foam .
the bonding can be accomplished by an suitable means such as with a chemical bonding agent .
however , it is preferred that the hydrophilic foam layer 20 be heat bonded to substrate 18 so as to eliminate any harmful effects from migrating chemicals or leaching of bonding agents .
