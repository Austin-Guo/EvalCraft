crampon and snowshoe combinations are disclosed , wherein the crampon or terrain - engaging cleat can be a traditional ice crampon used on a rigid and essentially unbending boot , or a soft boot cleat which engages only the front portion of the boot , forward of the heel , permitting boot flexing . the snowshoe has in a toe or ball area a registry plate configured to engage with the crampon , preferably between depending teeth or other structure of the crampon , and preferably with a self - centering feature as the crampon is lowered down onto the registry plate . once the cleat or crampon is fully engaged down against the plate , it is substantially locked in position against relative shifting or rotation , and lifting of the boot off the back of the crampon is restricted by clips or straps , preferably flexible straps extending up from the registry plate and securable to brackets or hooks on the crampon device . specific configurations of cleats or crampons are also disclosed , for use with or without snowshoes .
fig1 shows a snowshoe 10 having a frame 12 and deck portions 14 , 16 and 18 , in a first embodiment of a snowshoe / crampon combination . a boot 20 with an attached crampon or terrain - engaging cleat 22 is secured to the snowshoe by a front harness assembly of the snowshoe , generally identified by 24 . as can be seen in the drawing , the snowshoe deck portions 16 and 18 have relatively large openings 26 and 28 , and these accommodate rear and front groups of crampon teeth , as further explained below . fig2 shows the snowshoe 10 alone . the decking areas 14 , 16 and 18 in this preferred embodiment are retained to the snowshoe frame 12 by sections of decking material which extend around the frame and are riveted together to the main body of decking , as at 30 , for example , and as shown in u . s . pat . no . 5 , 440 , 827 . the snowshoe &# 39 ; s decking can be comprised of fewer pieces if desired . as fig2 reveals , the snowshoe 10 has a front harness assembly 24 , preferably pivotable about a horizontal axis which can be provided by one or more resilient straps 32 wrapped around the frame and retaining the harness assembly preferably in a toe - down biased position , as shown in u . s . pat . nos . 5 , 253 , 437 , 5 , 440 , 827 , 5 , 699 , 630 and 5 , 687 , 491 . however , the front harness and pivot assembly is without a front claw or cleat , nor does the snowshoe have any rear cleat . instead , the open areas 28 and 26 provide space for a user wearing a boot and a crampon such as the crampon 22 to step into the snowshoe and lock the crampon to the snowshoe , after which the teeth of the crampon can be used as front and rear cleats for the snowshoe . fig3 and 6 show a crampon or terrain - engaging cleat 22 which is configured for use with the snowshoe of the invention . important features of the cleat device 22 are that its rear group 34 of teeth is positioned to pass through the rear , generally heel - located opening 26 of the snowshoe , that its front group 36 of teeth is positioned to pass through the opening 28 at the front of the snowshoe , and that the front group 36 of teeth be configured to straddle over and engage with a front harness plate or registry plate 38 which is an important feature of the snowshoe . as seen in fig2 and 3 , the crampon 22 can be attached to the snowshoe via the harness mounting plate 38 , by simply stepping into the snowshoe in a toe - down position when the crampon is worn on the user &# 39 ; s boot . with the strap assembly 24 in a loosened or released position , the user inclines the boot with the toe downward , at a steeper angle than the orientation of the mounting plate 38 itself , inserting a pair of opposed , left and right side teeth 40 ( the left tooth 40 is visible in fig3 and 6 ) down through a clearance 42 provided at each side of a front portion of the mounting plate 38 . the opposed crampon teeth 40 have inclined front surfaces so as to extend under tip structure 44 at each side of the front end of the mounting plate , the tip structures comprising a front bar across the front end of the plate 38 . the crampon teeth 40 each comprise a part of a side protrusion 46 , which may also include another tooth 48 just behind the tooth 40 , and which has a width w ( fig6 ) at its upper end , near a deck or frame 50 of the crampon , which is matched to the length of the clearance 42 in the harness plate 38 . the forward side of the tooth 40 , that is , of each side protrusion 46 , is inclined forwardly / downwardly as shown , so that it engages under the structure 44 of the plate 38 and then locks the crampon in place after the crampon has been rotated such that its back end 52 is downward and the front portion 54 , with the front group 36 of teeth , is in contact with the surface of the harness plate 38 . fig6 shows the crampon 22 in side view , with bales 56 and 58 removed ( shown in fig3 ). the illustrated crampon is of a known configuration , marketed as the sabre tooth crampon by black diamond equipt . ltd . of salt lake city , utah . fig5 shows in plan , developed view the harness registry plate 38 which cooperates with the crampon 22 . the clearance 42 at each side of the front end of the harness plate is shown as formed between the tip structure 44 and a wing extension 60 at each side , spaced back from the tips 44 . the harness plate 38 in this embodiment is further configured to provide adequate spaces 61 for a further posterior pair of crampon teeth 62 , still in the forward set 36 of teeth , as seen in fig3 and 6 . another pair of teeth 64 , the most posterior of the forward set of teeth 36 , are received in clearances 66 of the harness plate as shown in fig5 . at the rear end of the harness plate 38 are a pair of arms 68 , each of which has a tab 69 at its end , to be bent upward approximately at right angles along a line indicated by dashes 70 in fig5 . these tabs , as seen in fig2 provide a mounting for the strap assembly 24 which extends over the user &# 39 ; s boot after the user steps into the snowshoe with the crampon . the strap assembly 24 is adjustable , and preferably has a ratchet - type buckle known as a ladder lock buckle , of the type that tightens a strap by one or more notches in a rack of notches with each pivot stroke of a buckle lever , and which allows easy release by lifting the lever to a full - back position . fig4 a bottom view of the snowshoe with the crampon attached , illustrates the engagement of the front end of the crampon with the snowshoe &# 39 ; s harness assembly , and particularly with the harness plate 38 . fig4 reveals that the side protrusion 46 at each side of the crampon has been closely engaged within the clearance 42 at each side of the mounting plate 38 . also , the drawing shows the other pairs of teeth 62 and 64 as residing in the side clearances 61 and 66 of the harness plate . in this position the frame or deck 50 of the crampon is against the upper surface of the harness plate 38 . the crampon teeth generally surround the plate 38 , by which is meant that teeth extend down alongside the plate at least at front and sides . as can be appreciated from fig4 the act of stepping into the front harness of the snowshoe with the crampon teeth 40 engaging as discussed above and shown in the drawings , locates the crampon precisely relative to the harness assembly and the snowshoe , establishing proper rotational orientation between the crampon and the snowshoe , such that the snowshoe is firmly secured to the crampon against left or right rotation . for this purpose , as shown in fig5 and also seen in fig4 the mounting and registry plate 38 has angled surfaces 72 just aft of the tips 44 , so that when the crampon teeth are inserted into and under the tips 44 , these obliquely angled surfaces 72 guide the crampon into the precise position , particularly when the heel is rotated down to closely engage the crampon &# 39 ; s side protrusions in the clearances 42 . fig7 - 12 show another form of terrain - engaging cleat or crampon 80 which can be used on a boot for enhancing traction such as in icy or semi - icy conditions , or in combination with a snowshoe wherein the device 80 provides a cleat for the snowshoe , as illustrated . fig7 shows a cleat plate or base plate 82 which is a principal component of the terrain - engaging cleat or crampon 80 shown in fig8 . the base 82 has a generally flat platform 84 , a pair of front end teeth 86 integrally formed with and extending downwardly / forwardly from the platform 84 , and further pairs of teeth 88 and 90 . the two teeth 88 are angled teeth in this preferred embodiment , just aft of the two frontal teeth 86 as shown . the angled teeth 88 are angled relative to the forward / aft direction of movement of the crampon and relative to the transverse direction of the cleat device 82 . thus , these teeth 88 provide traction for the crampon in both the forward / back directions and in lateral directions . the additional teeth 90 are side teeth , further aft on the crampon or terrain - engaging cleat . the base member also preferably includes a tail extension 92 , defining a rear attachment point 94 for a part of the harness assembly 96 shown in fig8 . the cleat base 82 in a preferred embodiment is formed as a stainless steel stamping . as shown , the teeth 86 , 88 and 90 bend downwardly from edges of the platform 84 , in bends 98 , 100 and 102 . each of these bends may include a stiffener pleat 104 , comprising an indentation formed into the metal for stiffening the teeth at each of these bends . stiffener pleats are also shown at 105 in the platform 84 . the frontal teeth 86 are tapered , generally triangular as shown and are angled down about 45 ° in the embodiment shown . this angle preferably is between about 40 ° and 50 °, or more broadly , between about 35 ° and 55 °. fig7 also shows various holes through the deck or platform portion of the stamping 82 , four of which identified as 106 are used for attaching a footbed 110 and the harness assembly 96 to the base 82 . this can be a contoured footbed as in u . s . pat . no . 5 , 687 , 491 . as also seen in fig7 and 8 , each of the angled teeth 88 and the side teeth 90 comprises a relatively narrow neck 112 , which extends from the platform 84 down through the bend 102 , into a flat area 113 , 114 of the tooth , substantially wider than the neck portion . the flat face area 113 , 114 of the tooth , with its larger width , provides good gripping traction in penetrable terrain . as seen in the drawings , the maximum width of this flat face area , in each tooth 88 and 90 , preferably is at least 50 % wider than the narrower neck 112 . the drawings also show that each tooth 88 , 90 defines a point 116 at its bottom , for engaging ice when encountered . importantly , these ice points 116 are substantially directly beneath the stiffener pleats 104 , so that if the terrain - engaging device 80 is used on rigid ice , the stress of supporting the weight of the user through the bends 100 , 102 in the base portion is efficiently resisted by the stiffeners . the assembled terrain - engaging cleat device or crampon 80 as shown in fig8 has a harness assembly 96 which can be similar to those produced by atlas snow - shoe company and incorporated as the front harness assembly of a snowshoe , such as on atlas models nos . 1022 and 1033 . the harness includes a web which has a central , bottom section or harness shell 120 that is secured to the metal platform 84 , preferably being positioned beneath the platform 84 as shown . with reference to all of fig7 - 12 , this harness 96 has forward harness legs 122 and rear harness legs 124 extending up and outwardly from the harness shell 120 , as shown . these discrete legs of the harness web are positioned to extend over the ball of the foot , or essentially between the toe area and the ball area , with the legs 122 ; and from the arch area or slightly forward of the arch area , over the top of the foot generally as seen in fig9 . straps 126 , 127 extend between the webs to closely retain the web and the crampon device 80 on the foot . these straps 126 and 127 , in a preferred embodiment , can comprise a single strap connected in a “ z ” type arrangement as described in copending application ser . no . 10 , 199 , filed jan . 21 , 1998 and incorporated herein by reference . as in that copending application , the strap arrangement employed in the crampon device 80 provides for easy adjustment and quick and easy attachment of the crampon or cleat device 80 to the shoe or boot . in addition , there is preferably included a heel strap 130 for increased stability and torsion resistance , this strap preferably extending from rear extensions 132 of the harness web 96 . as seen in the drawings , the tail extension 92 and rear attachment point 94 of the main base member 82 ( fig7 ) is important in providing an attachment point as far back on the crampon device 80 as needed for good binding and stability . that rear attachment point 94 is located in the arch area of the boot , slightly forward of the heel , as can be seen in fig9 . as indicated in the drawings , the footbed 110 can be secured to the base member 82 by rivets 134 , but also by gluing . the rivets 134 also serve to secure the harness shell 120 to the platform 84 of the metal base member 82 . fig9 shows the user &# 39 ; s shoe or boot 136 , wearing the crampon device 80 of the invention , and also engaged in a snowshoe 140 . as also seen in fig1 , the snowshoe has decking 142 which preferably includes a rear cleat at 144 ( the cleat actually extends below the decking ), and the snowshoe has a front boot binding assembly 146 that includes a registry plate 148 for the crampon , which may be supported on tensioned straps 150 that afford a biased pivoting movement of the toe , and which includes a single strap 152 for extending over the top of the foot area of the boot , but which does not include a front cleat . see also fig1 a - 12 . the terrain - engaging cleat or crampon 80 of the invention supplies the front cleat , since the teeth 86 , 88 and 90 extend down and around the registry plate 148 . this is similar to the registry of the front portion 54 of the full - foot crampon 22 into a snowshoe in the earlier described embodiment . fig9 - 12 show one form of registry plate 148 for use with the crampon device 80 in this embodiment of the invention . fig1 - 15 show alternatives , described below . the registry plate 148 has a front bar 155 which extends across a forward end 156 of the plate and has extending tips 158 at left and right . these , as seen in fig9 and 12 , are to be engaged between back sides of the front end teeth 86 and forward edges 159 of the angled teeth 88 that serve as protrusions similar to the protrusions 46 in fig3 and 4 . since the teeth 88 themselves are angled preferably downwardly and outwardly at an angle relative to the lateral and straight - ahead directions , this inclined forward edge 159 has a forward component to its orientation , so that when the front bar 155 is in place under the crampon , with the tips 158 between the teeth 86 and the inclined edges 159 , the crampon cannot be lifted straight up at its front end , being confined by the front bar 155 interacting with the inclined edge 159 . thus , when the user wearing the crampon device 80 steps into the snowshoe , this must be done with the toe tipped downwardly , until the frontal bar 155 of the registry plate is correctly in position between the teeth 86 and the teeth 88 . at that point , the user can pivot the foot downwardly onto the plate , then attach a pair of straps 161 to the harness via securing hooks 163 , as seen particularly in fig8 and 10 . this is one preferred system for holding the boot down against the plate . the straps 161 can be of an elastic polymer that flexes somewhat but exerts enough force to keep the boot against the plate . by this arrangement the user can conveniently pull up on the two straps 161 and hook them on the hooks 163 , avoiding additional straps over the top of the foot . the registry plate 148 shown in fig1 a and 11b , as well as in fig9 and 12 , has side stabilizers formed as projections 160 on each side , somewhat aft of the middle of the plate . these are bent downwardly ( fig1 b and 12 ) and positioned to engage against inner sides of the side teeth 90 , and they are preferably located so as to engage between the stiffener pleats 104 on the base cleat device 82 shown in fig7 . when the user engages the front bar 155 in place , with the toe of the boot and crampon tipped down , and positions the front bar correctly between the crampon teeth 86 and 88 , then rotates the foot downwardly , these side stabilizers 160 then engage inside surfaces of the teeth 90 to lock the cleat in place on the registry plate 148 . from fig1 and 11 a - b can be seen one preferred method of securement of the registry plate 148 to the snowshoe . the plate has holes 164 through which rivets pass to secure the plate to the snowshoe &# 39 ; s tensioned front straps 150 , as in fig1 . the tensioned straps 150 in this embodiment are spaced apart sufficiently to allow the side teeth 90 of the crampon device ( fig7 and 8 ) to pass down between the straps , one such tooth at each side of the registry plate 148 . this is best seen in the bottom view of fig1 , which also reveals the side stabilizers 160 as engaging against inside surfaces of the side teeth 190 . this tight engagement is made as the wearer rotates the cleat down onto the registry plate 148 . fig1 - 15 show alternative configurations of registry plates 170 , 180 and 190 . in fig1 and 13a , the registry plate 170 is quite similar to the plate 148 , except at the front end . there , a front finger 172 extends forwardly and is formed into a somewhat downwardly dipping hook , in position to be engaged in a v notch 173 between the front teeth 86 of the crampon , as seen particularly in fig7 . this helps the user place the crampon correctly on the registry plate , since the registry plate is not visible beneath the foot and boot . with the central hooked finger 172 extending forward as a tactile guide , the user can feel it between the frontal crampon teeth 86 , in the notch 173 , then step down with the toe , causing the hooked finger 122 to shift the cleat &# 39 ; s frontal teeth 86 left or right as needed and back against the front to position the front of the cleat correctly . again , side stabilizers 160 center the aft parts of the cleat or crampon by engagement between the structure of the side teeth 90 as the foot is rotated down . although not shown in fig1 a - 13b , the plate 170 can have a front bar similar to the front bar 155 of fig1 - 12 , in addition to the hook 172 . fig1 a - b again show a registry plate 180 which is similar to the plates 148 and 170 , except at the front end . here , a slot 182 is formed by front end structure 184 , and this slot is positioned to receive the frontal crampon teeth 86 . again , this gives a tactile indicator for the user to locate the front of the pleat or crampon correctly , prior to rotating the arch of the foot downwardly to engage the crampon with the outboard side stabilizers 160 . in this case , the user again preferably tips the crampon down slightly , to best insert the frontal teeth 86 down through the slot 182 , prior to rotating the arch downward . as indicated , the front end structure 184 on this plate 180 preferably is angled upwardly somewhat , to better catch the frontal teeth 86 . if the user is off - center with the crampon , the tapered outside edges of the teeth guide the crampon to the correct position . fig1 a - b show a registry plate 190 which is again similar to the other plates described above in many respects . at the front of the registry plate 190 is a tapering frontal apex 192 with a raised disk 194 similar to a rivet head , spaced upwardly by a narrow neck 195 from the surface of the frontal apex 192 . the frontal apex 192 is angled downwardly from a bend 193 . again , a tactile indicator is provided for the user in placing the toe end of the cleat or crampon 80 correctly . the frontal teeth 86 of the crampon are moved downwardly and forwardly against the neck of the rivet head or locator disk 194 , such that the neck 195 of the disk becomes positioned in the v notch 173 between the frontal teeth 86 . as in the last described embodiment , even if the user holds the foot laterally left or right to some extent , the downward engagement of the frontal teeth 86 will become self - centering of the crampon relative to the registry plate 190 . fig1 shows another embodiment of a terrain engaging cleat or crampon 200 according to the invention . this cleat or crampon 200 is similar in many respects to the previously described crampon 80 , but employs a different cleat base 202 , not specifically designed to engage with a snowshoe . the simpler cleat base 202 has a rack of front teeth 204 , positioned at the bottom of a downwardly / forwardly angled frontal bend 206 , and has a pair of side teeth 208 . its harness 210 may be essentially the same as described previously , but in this embodiment the crampon omits the tail extension 92 ( fig7 ) of the earlier embodiment , thus providing a less bulky terrain - engaging cleat or crampon . the crampon device 200 includes a rear strap 210 for extending around the back of the user &# 39 ; s boot or shoe . again , a footbed 212 , which may be a flexible , rubbery footbed and which may be contoured as in u . s . pat . no . 5 , 687 , 491 , is secured down to the platform of the cleat base 202 . the above described preferred embodiments are intended to illustrate the principles of the invention , but not to limit its scope . other embodiments and variations to this preferred embodiment will be apparent to those skilled in the art and may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention .
