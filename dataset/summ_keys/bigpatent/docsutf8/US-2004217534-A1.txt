[ 0024 ] fig2 is a cross sectional view of apparatus 2 , as illustrated in fig1 . fig2 more clearly shows how the various elements interact with each other . [ 0025 ] fig3 shows the introduction of media 3 into apparatus 2 . it is to be understood that media 3 can be any suitable media upon which printing or other similar types of imaging can be placed . as shown in fig3 bundle clamp 5 is conventionally moved to a downward or closed position to allow media 3 to come into contact with drive rollers 10 . in this manner , sheet diverter 12 causes sheets of media 3 to accumulate along lower bundle plane 8 . as shown in fig4 as a new sheet of media 3 is placed upon bundle 50 , the sheet of media 3 is traversed along bundle 50 . the various sheets of media 3 of bundle 50 are pre - cut prior to being introduced into apparatus 2 . in this manner , when the spine of bundle 50 is formed and flattened , the various media sheets of bundle 50 will align to form a straightedge , thereby resembling a booklet . consequently , the various sheets of media 3 of bundle 50 must be placed upon bundle 50 , as shown in fig4 in order to produce a “ stairstep ” effect between the adjacent sheets of media 3 of bundle 50 . this is accomplished through the use of bundle clamp 14 and drive rollers 10 . as a sheet of media 3 is introduced on to bundle 50 , the leading sheet edge of media 3 is conventionally monitored so that when leading sheet edge of media 3 reaches a desired point along bundle 50 , bundle clamp 14 is lowered or closed on to the sheet of media 3 and drive rollers 10 creates a trailing edge buckle that causes the trailing end of the sheet of media 3 to position itself at the other end ( trailing end ) of bundle 50 . as shown in fig5 after the desired number of sheets of media 3 are accumulated , in order to form bundle 50 , bundle clamps 5 and 14 are conventionally lowered on to bundle 50 in order to hold bundle 50 in place . as shown in fig6 stapler anvil 20 is conventionally lowered by anvil drive gear 22 on to bundle 50 in order to fasten the sheets of media 3 of bundle 50 into place through the use of fastener 18 . also , bundle clamps 5 and 14 are conventionally raised . as shown in fig7 after bundle 50 has been fastened , hand - off rollers 16 interact with bundle 50 in order to cause bundle 50 to traverse along bundle diverter 23 and interact with hand - off rollers 24 . as shown in fig8 hand - off rollers 24 traverse fastened bundle 50 along upper bundle plane 26 and conventionally centers the area where bundle 50 was fastened over crease wire 28 . it must also be noted that once bundle 50 has been transferred to upper bundle plane 26 , another sheet of media 3 can be introduced on to lower bundle plane 8 in order to begin the formation of another bundle 50 . as shown in fig9 crease wire 28 is conventionally raised by anvil drive gear 22 such that spine 52 in bundle 50 is formed between crease rollers 30 . as shown in fig1 , crease wire 28 and crease rollers 30 cause bundle 50 and spine 52 to traverse through clamping jaws 32 and interact with spine form roller 28 . this manner , clamping jaws 32 are caused to clamp down on bundle 50 and , more particularly , spine 52 in order to hold spine 52 in place to create a spine edge . after clamping jaws 32 have clamped down on bundle 50 and spine 52 , v - shaped spine form roller 28 is traversed along the length of the edge of spine 52 through the use of carriage drive screw 40 , drive nut 42 , carriage - centering rollers 34 , and guide rail 36 in order to flatten spine 52 . tensioners 39 are utilized in order to keep spine form roller 38 centered along spine 52 as spine form roller 38 flattens spine 52 . in this manner , substantially any raised areas or “ pillowing ” located along spine 52 is eliminated . as shown in fig1 , after booklet 100 has been formed and conventionally ejected from apparatus 2 , another fastened bundle 50 is traversed from lower bundle plane 8 to upper bundle plane 26 so that another booklet 100 can be formed through the flattened of spine 52 . it is to be understood that the present invention can be embodied in any computer - readable medium for use by or in connection with an instruction execution system such as a computer / processor based system or other system that can fetch or obtain the logic from the computer - readable medium and execute instructions contained therein . a “ computer - readable medium ” can be any medium that contains , stores , or maintains programming for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system . the computer - readable medium can comprise any one of many physical media such as , for example , electronic , magnetic , optical , electromagnetic , infrared , or semiconductor media . more specific examples of a suitable computer - readable medium would include , but are not limited to , a portable magnetic computer diskette such as floppy diskettes or hard drives , a random access memory ( ram ), a read - only memory ( rom ), an erasable programmable read - only memory , or a portable compact disc . once given the above disclosure , many other features , modifications or improvements will become apparent to the skilled artisan . such features , modifications or improvements are , therefore , considered to be a part of this invention , the scope of which is to be determined by the following claims .
