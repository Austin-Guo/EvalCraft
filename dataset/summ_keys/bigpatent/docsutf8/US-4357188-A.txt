a method for manufacturing cigarette filters which have a well - stabilized shape in which acetate fibrous tows impregnated with carboxylic acid ester of polyol are formed into a predetermined shape , uniformly impregnated with water , and irradiated with microwave energy . water is used during the application of microwave energy to enhance the absorption of microwave energy and hence heating of the filter . this causes the carboxylic acid ester of polyol to very rapidly disperse causing it to permeate into the acetate fiber to rapidly complete the stabilization and solidification of the filter .
the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings . an apparatus according to the present invention will be described referring to fig1 . reference numeral 1 designates a bale for cellulose ester fibers and numeral 2 designates a tow drawn from the bale 1 . reference numeral 3 denotes a preliminary tow opening device for producing a filter rod having a uniform filtration efficiency from the tow 2 . reference numerals 4 and 5 denote nip roller type opening devices . reference numeral 6 denotes a device for impregnating carboxylic acid ester of polyol into the opened tow 2 . reference numeral 7 denotes a device for feeding water to the opened tow 2 . the tow 2 impregnated with carboxylic acid ester of polyol is converged by a guide 8 ( which may be dispensed with if desired ). the periphery of the tow 2 is then wrapped with a continuous endless belt 9 made of material through which microwave energy can easily penerate and the tow is passed through a microwave applicator 10 . it is necessary that water be provided to the filter rod during the microwave process . the filter rod is rapidly cured by the water contained in the filter rod and by carboxylic acid ester of polyol to thereby provide a filter rod having a stabilized shape . the final filter rod is cut by cutter to a predetermined length . fig2 shows an enlarged cross - sectional view of the microwave applicator section in which reference numeral 17 denotes a tubular forming guide through which the microwave penerates and numerals 13 to 16 denote guides for forming the fibrous tow into a fibrous rod . the fibrous rod 9 &# 39 ; encased in the endless belt 9 is delivered by these guides . it is necessary that the fibrous rod passing through a microwave applicator portion 12 of the applicator 10 contain water uniformly . the water is impregnated into the fibrous tow before the fibrous tow is formed into the fibrous rod . otherwise , it is possible to provide at an inlet or an intermediate position of the applicator a device for feeding vaporized moisture to the fibrous rods . in this case , steam may be used as the vaporized moisture . it is preferable that the belt through which the microwave energy is transmitted be made of material through which vaporized moisture is also readily transmitted . for example , the belt can be made of a fabric material . for use with the present invention , the cellulose containing fibrous material can be regenerated acetylated cellulose or the like . particularly , cellulose diacetate is preferable . any fiber shape , either a long or a short fiber , may be used . carboxylic acid ester of polyol material used with the invention is preferably a material selected from the group of diacetate , dipropinate , dibutylate and triacetate of a polyol selected from grycerols or polyethylene glycols wherein the unit of ethylene glycol , diethylene glycol , triethylene glycol , tetraethylene glycol or polyethylene glycol which has an ethylene glycol polymerizing unit of 200 to 600 . in these compounds , triethylene glycol diacetate and glycerol triacetate are preferable . the weight percentage of carboxylic acid ester of polyol is preferably 2 to 15 %, more preferably 4 to 8 %, with respect to the cellulose ester fiber . in case the weight percentage of the carboxylic acid ester of polyol is not greater than 2 %, the molding characteristics during the manufacture of the fibrous rod from the cellulose ester fibrous material are reduced . if the weight percentage thereof is greater than 15 %, a fibrous tow is soft and poor in form stability . such a fibrous rod is not desired due to the poor smoke taste thereof . the water used in the invention may be in either a liquid or vapor state . the moisture is that absorbed into the cellulose containing fiber which adheres thereto and is held between neighboring fibers . it is preferable to use water in amounts of 1 to 100 %, preferably 4 to 40 % of the fiber weight . if the amount of water used is not greater than 1 % by weight , the microwave efficiency is significantly reduced and the rod forming characteristics deteriorate . if water is used excessively , a large amount of energy is needed to remove the moisture from the finished fibrous rods . for providing the cellulose ester fiber with water , many known methods can be used to adjust the moisture content of the cellulose ester fiber in advance . moisture can be sprayed , a water containing roller or rolling brush can be used , or a steam feeding passage can be provided at a midportion of the fiber rod forming apparatus . in the present invention , a suitable belt is , for example , a tape shaped member through which microwave energy can readily pass . materials which are suitable for polyolefins such as polyethylene or polypropylene , polyfluoroethylene , polyester , cotton and linen . a belt made of sheet material from which water is readily removed is preferable . for this reason , it is preferable that the belt be made up of a water permeable tape with suitable micro - or macro - perforations . for use with the present invention , the microwave frequency can be made from 300 to 30 , 000 mhz or , preferably 915 ± 25 mhz , 2 , 450 ± 50 mhz , 5 , 800 ± 75 mhz or 22 , 125 ± 125 mhz . since the fibrous rods produced using the present invention solidify in configuration in a very short period of time , the production efficiency therefor is remarkably superior to that of the prior art . heat applied to the fibrous rod is generated utilizing microwave absorption in water which is achieved at a temperature of approximately 100 ° c . therefore , the energy needed to form the fiber rod is small and the cooling energy needed is also small . the configuration stabilization of the fibrous rod produced according to the present invention is high so that the amount of fiber used in the fibrous rod can be increased to thereby increase the filtration efficiency . it is preferable to use a 15 , 000 to 70 , 000 d tow for the cellulose ester fiber . the cross section of the fibrous rod produced according to the present invention may be rectangular or star - shaped as well as circular and oblong shapes . a fibrous tow processed according to the invention may also be used as a liquid retainer or a blood separation device . a crimped cellulose diacetate tow of 4 dpf and 50 , 000 d in total was drawn from a bale and processed using a water spray . after glycerol triacetate was applied to the opened tow so that its weight percentage was 6 % of the fiber weight , water was sprayed thereon so that the water percentage was 11 percent by weight . after the tow to which water and the glycerol triacetate were applied was converged by a guide , the periphery thereof was surrounded by a continuous endless belt made of woven polytetrafluoroethylene fiber . the tow in this condition was passed through a microwave applicator . the frequency of the microwaves was 2 , 450 ± 50 mhz . the time period for passage through the microwave applicator was approximately 1 sec . a plan view photograph of fibrous rod thus obtained is shown in fig4 . the configuration stabilization of the rod was quite acceptable . no deformities were observed . the water percentage thereof was about 6 % by weight . glycerol triacetate was fully dispersed in the fiber and the rod had a suitable hardness . a second fibrous rod was produced as specified in u . s . pat . no . 3 , 413 , 689 . the second fibrous rod from which the wrapping paper was removed is shown in fig3 from which it may be seen that the configuration stability was poor and the rod was expanded radially . also , the rod was not fully hard and was not suitable for a cigarette filter . after crimped cellulose diacetate tows of 4 dpf and 50 , 000 d were opened , triethylene glycol diacetate or glycerol triacetate was sprayed thereon with ratios as specified in table 1 . after these tows were converged by guide 8 shown in fig1 the tows were surrounded by a continuous endless belt woven of polyester fiber and were fed into the microwave applicator . vaporized water was supplied from the inlet portion of the microwave applicator 10 with the values specified in table 1 and the tows were processed with microwaves of frequency 2 , 450 ± 50 mhz to thereby form wrapperless fibrous rods . the speed of the tows through the microwave applicator was specified in table 1 . the thus obtained fiber &# 39 ; s rod had a good configuration stability . table 1______________________________________ 1 2 3 4______________________________________triethyleneglycol di -
