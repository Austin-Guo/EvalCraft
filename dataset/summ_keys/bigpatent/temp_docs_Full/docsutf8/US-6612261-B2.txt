fig1 shows a plan view of a canine training structure 100 . the device 100 may include a first surface 104 having a pair of generally parallel sides spaced by a first predetermined distance d 1 and a second surface 102 having a first region 102 a having generally parallel sides spaced by a second predetermined distance d 2 and a second region 102 b having a first dimension generally corresponding to the first predetermined distance d 1 and a second dimension generally corresponding to the second predetermined distance d 2 . in a preferred embodiment , the first surface 104 has a length l 1 of 4 feet and a first predetermined distance d 1 of 3 feet , the first region 102 a of the second surface 102 has a length l 2 a of 4 feet and a second predetermined distance d 2 of 1 foot , and the second region 102 b of the second surface 102 has a length l 2 b of 2 feet . the second region 102 b maybe referred to as a transition region , where the width of the structure transitions from a wide width to a narrow width or vice versa depending on which end of the structure the canine enters . the surfaces 102 and 104 may include a plurality of protuberances or raised slats 106 , preferably three   fourths of an inch thick and one   and   half inches wide that preferably extend from edge to edge of the surfaces . the slats 106 may be equally spaced on the surfaces , preferably spaced approximately 12 ″ apart . the slats 106 may provide a pushing surface to aid the canine in the ascent or decline of the structure 100 . the transition in the dimension of the second region 102 b from d 1 to d 2 may be linear or non linear . the surface 102 and 104 may be made from wood , preferably fir plywood or aluminum . the surfaces may have a textured coating to reduce injury to a canine . as shown in fig2 appropriate structural members 108 and 110 may support the surfaces 102 and 104 respectively . the structure 100 may rest on a support surface , for example the ground or an indoor floor . the structural members 108 and 110 may be formed from wood or metallic tubing , for example hollow aluminum or steel tube stock . the tube stock may be joined using mechanical fastener or may be joined , for example by welding . the surfaces 102 and 104 or the structural member 108 and 110 may be coupled by a hinge 116 . the hinge may be mechanically fastened to the surfaces 102 and 104 or the structural members 108 and 110 . the hinge 116 may be a piano hinge that preferably extends from edge to edge of the structure . the hinge 116 may include a removable hinge pin to allow for easier transport . the hinge may be positioned to allow the structure to lie flat on a surface . handles 122 may be added to the structure to aid in transportation , preferably , the handles are located on the under surface of the structure . the structure 100 may include a tensioning device 114 coupled to opposing end of the surfaces 102 and 104 or the structural members 108 and 110 to form the structure into a triangular shape . the tensioning device may be a length of chain or cable . the length of the tensioning device may be adjusted to change the overall height h of the structure 100 at its peak . to begin training a canine the structure may be laid flat on a surface . as the canine develops confidence , the overall height h of the structure may be increased by decreasing the length of the tensioning device 114 . in a preferred embodiment , an interior angle formed between the first surface and the second surface is preferably an obtuse angle , and more preferably is approximately 110 . in this preferred configuration , the height h of the structure 100 is approximately 2 feet 8 inches . the tensioning device may be coupled to the surfaces 102 and 104 or the structural member 108 and 110 with an eyehook 112 . the canine 120 may enter the structure 100 from either end . the canine climbs the entrance surface and then descends the exit surface . when the canine enters the structure as shown in fig2 the second region 102 b allows the canine to redirect his travel towards the narrower first region 102 a . if the structure did not transition from one width to another , a canine entering the structure as shown in fig2 accidentally could fall off the structure and be injured . fig3 shows a plan view of another canine training structure 100 ′. the device 100 ′ may include a first surface 104 ′ having a pair of generally parallel sides spaced by a first predetermined distance d 1 ′ and a second surface 102 ′ having a first region 102 a ′ having generally parallel sides spaced by a second predetermined distance d 2 ′ and a second region 102 b ′ having a first dimension generally corresponding to the first predetermined distance d 1 ′ and a second dimension generally corresponding to the second predetermined distance d 2 ′. in a preferred embodiment , the first surface 104 ′ has a length l 1 ′ of 6 feet and a first predetermined distance d 1 ′ of 1 foot , the first region 102 a ′ of the second surface 102 ′ has a length l 2 a ′ of 4 feet and a second predetermined distance d 2 ′ of 3 feet , and the second region 102 b ′ of the second surface 102 has a length l 2 b ′ of 2 feet . the second region 102 b ′ maybe referred to as a transition region , where the width of the structure transitions from a wide width to a narrow width or vice versa depending on which end of the structure the canine enters . the surfaces 102 ′ and 104 ′ may include a plurality of protuberances or raised slats 106 ′, preferably three   fourths of an inch thick and one   and   half inches wide that preferably extend from edge to edge of the surfaces . the slats 106 ′ may be equally spaced on the surfaces , preferably spaced approximately 12 ″

may be linear or non linear . a hingeble joint 116 ′ may couple the first surface 104 ′ and the second surface 102 ′. suitable structural members may be used to support the first and second surfaces 104 ′ and 102 ′ respectively . a tensioning device coupled to the first and second surfaces may also be used to form the structure into a triangular shape . the length of the tensioning device may be adjusted to change the overall height of the structure at its peak . the dimensions given are exemplary and should not be construed as the only dimensions possible . these dimensions can be changed without departing from the present invention . it should be understood that , while the present invention has been described in detail herein , the invention can be embodied otherwise without departing from the principles thereof , and such other embodiments are meant to come within the scope of the present invention as defined in the following claim ( s ).
