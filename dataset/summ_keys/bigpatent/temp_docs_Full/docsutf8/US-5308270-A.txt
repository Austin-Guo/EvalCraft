a submarine   launched , ice   penetrating sonobuoy is disclosed . the buoy is pedo   shaped with a collapsible obturator tail   fin section removably attached at the tail   end , standard electronics in a mid   section and an explosive nose cone at the front . immediately after launch , the tail   fin section expands to exert a drag on the buoy to halt any forward motion . the tail   fin section is discarded and the nose cone and mid   section portion rise until the nose impacts the underside of the ice . upon impact , a pre   selected &# 34 ; shape &# 34 ; charge ruptures the ice and an a spring   antenna , connected to the mid   section , is raised through the hole .
referring now to the drawings , wherein like reference characters designate like or corresponding parts throughout the several views , there is illustrated in fig1 a pictorial depiction of the first stage of deployment of an ice   penetrating buoy 22 as it is launched from the buoy   launch tube 25 of a submarine ( not shown ), as is normal procedure in the industry . buoy 22 is about 5 inches in diameter and generally has an overall cigar shape and has a nose cone 27 , an upper , buoyant , electronics package section 28 and a lower electronics package section 29 , as will be further explained below , all removably joined together to a tail section 32 . buoy 22 has an overall length of about 22 inches . fig2 through 9 all show further details of the tail section and how it functions during buoy launch , then springs open to act as a large net to almost completely stop any forward motion and , finally , how it falls away when no longer needed . fig2 shows an isolated and enlarged side view of the tail end of buoy 22 , showing expandable obturator 34 in its compressed launch state . fig7 is an isolated and enlarged side view of the tail end of buoy 22 , showing expandable obturator 34 in its expanded position . obturator 34 , as seen in end views while compressed ( fig3 ) and when expanded ( fig8 ) is made from a combination of eight flexible , silicon rubber fins 36a   f . fins 36 are each constructed in the general shape of an arcuate section of a circle , as can be seen in fig8 . the silicone rubber used has a durometer of about 20 . at the smaller , base area of each fin is an obturator securing means , in the form of a molded t   section 38 , that can resist launch pressures of up to 2 , 000 to 3 , 000 p . s . i . in this base area , the thickness of the rubber is approximately 0 . 200 inches and , each fin is tapered from base 38 out to the tip 40 , where the thickness is around 0 . 060 inches . each fin has sculptured , opposite   sided contours to allow fin overlapping , as seen in fig4 and 9 . each section 38 is fitted into the open area between flanges 39 around the periphery of an obturator securing ring 42 that is fitted inside the hollow end of package section 29 ( as seen in fig2 and 7 ). securing ring 42 is a hollow ring piece that has , on its inner surface , ridges 43 that contain anchor weights 45 . anchor weights 45 are attached by cable 46 ( not shown in fig2 or 7 ) to the other standard sonobuoy components such as sensor 47 ( see fig1 ) inside lower electronics package 29 . silicone rubber is used for the fins to take advantage of its &# 34 ; memory &# 34 ; characteristics in that , as will be explained , fins 36 can be compressed to fit into the relatively narrow circumference of launch   tube 25 , and , when free after launch , will spring back to their original shape . tail section 32 and lower electronics package 29 are also bound together by a retainer spring 48 made from spring steel wire . as shown in fig1 , a pictorial depiction of the release of the retainer spring holding lower electronics section 29 and tail section 32 to upper electronics section 28 , spring 48 is comprised of a hoop portion 51 , that encircles the outer circumference of the junction of the upper and lower electronic sections , and a pair of elongated fingers 53 . as will be explained , once buoy 22 emerges from launch tube 25 , the tip ends 55 of fingers 53 are able to spring free from their retainer sockets 57 , thereby releasing tail end 32 . the first steps of the launch sequence of buoy 22 , as depicted in fig1 and 6 , starts with loading the compressed buoy 22 into launch tube 25 . as is known , buoy 22 is stored inside a flexible sleeve ( not shown ) that restricts hoop 51 and fingers 53 from any movements and maintains fins 36 in their compressed position . the sleeve is removed from buoy 22 as it gets loaded into launch tube 25 , and the tube is securely closed and latched . at buoy launch , pressures of approximately 2 , 000 to 3 , 000 p . s . i . are exerted against tail section 32 ( fig1 ). because of the contoured overlapping and tapered design of fins 36 , fins 36 will flex out against the inside wall of tube 25 , to form a concave shell , to trap the pressurized gas . fig5 shows a depiction of a side view of buoy 22 as it exits launch tube 25 and transitions into open water 60 and is immediately surrounded by a gas bubble 62 . now , the &# 34 ; memory &# 34 ; qualities of silicon rubber cause fins 36a   f , once they are free from the restriction of launch tube 25 , to restore to their original shape and &# 34 ; fan &# 34 ; out as like so many playing cards to form expanded obturator 34 . at this time , expanded obturator 34 acts first as a sail to accelerate buoy 22 through a transitional velocity region of gas bubble 62 and then as a dragnet to slow buoy 22 down once it gets into open water . of course , the size of bubble 62 will depend on the depth below the surface where buoy 22 is launched . as seen in fig6 buoy 22 passes out of gas bubble 62 , and the pressure effects thereof , and into open water 60 with some forward velocity . with the emergence of buoy 22 from within launch tube 25 , a major reaction now starts to take place . with no restrictions on it , retainer spring 48 attempts to open up . as seen in fig2 fingers 53 have been forced to conform to the exterior outline of section 29 , and the tops 55 placed into retainer sockets 57 in obturator retaining ring 42 . the spring action of fingers 53 will cause them to attempt to straighten out , thus removing tips 55 . the side   by   side location of retainer sockets 57 keeps fingers 53 secured immediately adjacent one   another , and this positioning , as well as the restriction of launch tube 25 , maintains hoop portion 51 tightly wrapped around the circumference of junction 64 between sections 28 and 29 . at junction 64 , each common end of sections 28 and 29 is constructed with extending tabs 66 , with each tab having a groove 68 pressed into the outer surface to seat hoop portion 51 ( see fig1 ). once buoy 22 completely emerges from launch tube 25 , the restriction on fingers 53 and hoop 51 is removed and the spring force therein urges the hoop to spread open and become unseated from groove 68 . as soon as this happens , section 28 then is no longer held in place adjacent section 29 and can separate . this will occur naturally due to the buoyant nature of section 28 as compared to the heavier   than   water nature of section 29 . in addition , since obturator securing ring 42 , with the release of tip ends 55 out of sockets 57 , no longer has a solid connection to lower electronics package 29 , expanded obturator 34 will simply fall away due to the larger drag force being exerted on fins 36 . also , a retainer plate 70 , in the form of a circular disk , that had been trapped by the previously compressed fins , is able to fall away and allow weight 45 and sensor 47 to be discharged through the rear end of package 29 . fig1   15 shows the final steps of movement of nose cone 27 and upper electronics package 28 . both of these sections are manufactured to be lighter than seawater , or buoyant , out of materials and by means known in the art , and , as seen in fig1 , will immediately start to rise once free of the heavier package 29 . nose cone 27 is made from a thin steel skin 72 containing a shaped charge of high explosive 74 . an internal copper cone 75 shapes the charge . a piezoelectric element 76 , as used in the industry , is fastened to the tip end of the nose , on the inside thereof , and is connected by wire 78 to a fuze 80 . upon impact with the underside of the ice 82 , piezoelectric element 76 is crushed and the electric impulse causes fuze 80 to detonate . this , in turn , detonates explosive 74 , which causes copper cone 75 to collapse ( see fig1 ). this , in turn , creates a focused , high velocity shock wave that , as shown in fig1 , ruptures a hole through the ice 82 . once the explosion occurs , a spring   wire antenna 84 is no longer trapped in its folded position and is able to spring out to stand through the ice . buoy 22 has now made air contact and can function as designed . finally , while the ice penetrating buoy has been described with reference to a particular embodiment , it should be understood that the embodiment is merely illustrative as there are numerous variations and modifications which may be made by those skilled in the art . thus , the invention is to be construed as being limited only by the spirit and scope of the appended claims .
