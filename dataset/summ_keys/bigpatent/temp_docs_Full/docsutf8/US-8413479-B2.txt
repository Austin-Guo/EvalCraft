a forging die tool set defines a cavity and includes a core rod in the cavity for shaping a void in a work piece . the core rod extends in a direction in which the work piece is introduced , compressed , and ejected from the cavity . the core rod includes an upper portion and a lower portion . the upper portion has a cross sectional shape that forms a certain shape in the work piece and a radially tapered section that tapers toward the lower portion of the core rod . the lower portion also has a cross sectional shape that forms a certain shape in the work piece , and the cross sectional shape of the upper portion differs from the cross sectional shape of the lower portion , the lower portion being a more wear resistant shape characterized by larger radii and the upper portion being a finishing shape with smaller radii for shaping the final form of the forged work piece .
in fig1 , 2 a   2 h , and 3 a   3 c , the illustrated components are symmetric about an axis passing vertically through the center of the apparatus . for simplicity , the components are only numbered on one side of the axis of symmetry . fig1 illustrates a forging die tool set 10 according to the present invention . the forging die tool set 10 includes a die 12 , an upper punch 14 , a lower punch 16 , a support shaft 18 , a support surface 20 , and a core rod 22 . the forging die tool set 10 forges a work piece 24 . the work piece 24 may be an annular powder metal blank such as a helical gear , a spur gear or the like . the die 12 surrounds the work piece 24 in a radially outward direction and contacts an outer surface 26 on the work piece 24 . the upper punch 14 and the lower punch 16 contact an upper surface 28 and a lower surface 30 , respectively , on the work piece 24 . the core rod 22 is located in the central void of the work piece 24 . a threaded fastener 32 passes through the core rod 22 and is screwed into an internal thread 33 in the support shaft 18 . the core rod 22 contacts an inner surface 34 on the work piece 24 . the upper punch 14 and the lower punch 16 are moved by independent actuators ( not shown ). these actuators may be mechanical , hydraulic , or the like . the die 12 and the support shaft 18 may also be moved by independent actuators to reduce cycle time . in addition , automatic component insertion and extraction mechanisms may also be used in the system . such mechanisms are well known in the art . according to the present invention , the core rod 22 includes two portions , upper core rod portion 36 and lower core rod portion 38 . lower core rod portion 38 is preferably made from a material which is resistant to deformation at high temperatures and pressures , such as high temperature steel . other materials which are resistant to deformation at high temperatures and pressures may also be used . such materials are well known in the art . using any such material is advantageous since the work piece 24 transfers a large amount of heat to the lower core rod portion 38 . additionally , forging dies are commonly used to create components with internal splines , or the like . in this case , the lower core rod portion 38 does not provide the final internal shape to the work piece 24 . instead , the lower core rod portion 38 includes rounded edges ( relatively larger radii at the corners ) instead of relatively more angled or squared corners of smaller radii in the final forged shape to provide additional resistance to wear and deformation compounded by heat and pressure during forging . for example , the distance between a sharp edge and the nearest point on a rounded edge in fig5 should be approximately 0 . 02 in . however , the size of the rounded edges may be increased to further provide resistance to wear and deformation compounded by heat and pressure . the rounded profile is sized relative to the squared profile so that the cross   sectional areas of the forging chamber adjacent to the upper and lower core rod portions are substantially the same , with only the shape changing so that the material of the workpiece can be displaced in equal volumes . referring again to fig1 , the upper core rod portion 36 is also preferably made from high temperature steel . alternatively , the upper core rod portion 36 may be made from carbide , ceramic , or other materials known in the art . additionally , the upper core rod portion 36 includes two sections , a sizing section 40 and a tapered section 42 . the sizing section 40 has similar geometry to the lower core rod portion 38 and contacts the work piece 24 during ejection from the die as explained below . the tapered section 42 separates the lower core rod portion 38 from the sizing section 40 and does not contact the work piece 24 . the tapered section 42 is relatively short compared to the height of the entire core rod 22 . for example , the tapered section 42 may be 0 . 25 inches in height . the tapered section 42 limits heat transfer between the lower core rod portion 38 and the sizing section 40 . limited heat transfer results in less deformation of the sizing section 40 . advantageously , the service life of the sizing section 40 and the core rod 22 is increased . additionally , when the forging die tool set 10 is used to create components with internal splines , or the like , the sizing section 40 of the upper core rod portion 36 provides the final internal shape to the work piece 24 . the process of using the forging die tool set 10 is explained in further detail below . fig4 a illustrates an example of the final internal shape of the work piece 24 . the inner surface 34 of the work piece 24 includes a plurality of involute spline surfaces 44 . the involute spline surfaces 44 permit torque transmission and independent axial motion between the work piece 24 and an adjacent shaft ( not shown ). the number of involute spline surfaces 44 and the spline size may be selected as appropriate for a particular application . for example , the spline size may be a standard size as published by ansi . alternatively , the final internal shape may be any spline shape known in the art . in any case , the sizing section 40 of the upper core rod portion 36 includes the negative of the final internal shape of the work piece 24 after the work piece is ejected from the forging die tool set . fig4 b illustrates an example of the rounded internal shape of an unfinished work piece 124 , after having been forged against the lower core rod portion 38 but prior to being refined by the upper core rod portion 36 . the inner surface 134 of the unfinished work piece 124 includes a plurality of rounded involute spline surfaces 144 . the lower core rod portion 38 includes the negative of the final internal shape with rounded corners . the shape imparted to the workpiece by the upper core rod portion 36 is said to be more refined than the shape imparted by the lower core rod portion 38 because the upper core rod portion 36 changes the shape imparted by the lower core rod portion 38 to be closer to the shape of the finished forged work piece 124 . in most cases , the more refined shape will have sharper corners , as is the case comparing fig4 a and 4 b . in addition and referring again to fig1 , the components of the forging die tool set 10 may form chamfers between the upper surface 28 and the inner surface 34 and between the lower surface 30 and the inner surface 34 . in addition , the upper core rod portion 36 and the lower core rod portion 38 should be designed such that the cross   sectional area of the cavity adjacent to each portion is equal . equivalently , the solid line in fig5 should enclose equal areas on both sides of the dashed line . if the cross   sectional area of the cavity adjacent to the lower core rod portion 38 is smaller than that adjacent to the upper core rod portion 36 , the work piece 24 will not occupy all of the sharp corners of the cavity adjacent to the upper core rod portion 36 . if the cross   sectional area of the cavity adjacent to the lower core rod portion 38 is larger than that adjacent to the upper core rod portion 36 , a burr will form on the work piece 24 or excessive tooling wear will occur . in addition , some forged components become deformed due to temperature and cooling rate differences between areas of the forged material . this deformation , or “ lobing ”, causes the final shape of a forged component to differ from the intended shape . lobing can be predicted using well   known finite element analysis computer programs . therefore , the shape of the core rod sections can be designed such that forged components meet manufacturing tolerances despite lobing . the lower punch 16 is used to push the work piece 24 out of the die 12 , as will be explained in further detail below . accordingly , the lower punch 16 is used to support the lower surface 30 of the work piece 24 without contacting either the lower core rod portion 38 or the upper core rod portion 36 when it ejects the work piece 24 from the die 12 . that is , the lower punch 16 may include the same internal cross sectional shape as the final shape of the work piece 24 , but radially enlarged to prevent interference with the core rod 22 . accordingly , the support shaft or core rod base 18 has an external cross sectional shape that may be the negative of the internal cross sectional shape of the lower punch 16 and fit closely with the lower punch 16 . also , the upper core rod portion 36 and the lower core rod portion 38 are sized and shaped to clear the unforged work piece when it is placed in the die 12 . the upper punch 14 is sized and shaped to clear the upper core rod portion 36 as the upper punch 14 moves past the upper core rod portion 36 . that is , the upper punch 14 includes the same internal cross sectional shape as the final shape of the work piece 24 , but slightly larger radially to prevent interference with the upper core rod portion 36 . accordingly , a small height of the lower core rod portion 38 at the top of the lower portion 38 may have the final internal shape of the work piece 24 to prevent contact with the upper punch 14 during the forging process . the process for forging the work piece 24 in the forging die tool set 10 is as follows . as shown in fig2 a , the forging die tool set 10 initially does not include the work piece 24 and the upper punch 14 is in a retracted position . next , the work piece 24 is placed in the die 12 as shown in fig2 b . the upper punch 14 then moves downward to contact the work piece 24 as shown in fig2 c . the upper punch 14 continues to move downward after initial contact with the work piece 24 . the work piece 24 is compressed between the upper punch 14 and the lower punch 16 as shown in fig2 d . the work piece 24 expands radially outwardly and inwardly to contact the die 12 and the lower core rod portion 38 , respectively . after the work piece 24 has been compressed , the upper punch 14 moves to its initial position as shown in fig2 e . in fig2 f , the lower punch 16 moves upward to shape the inner surface 34 of the work piece 24 using the sizing section 40 of the upper core rod portion 36 . after this step , deformation of the work piece 24 is complete and the work piece 24 is in a position to be removed from the forging die tool set 10 , as shown in fig2 g . in fig2 h , the lower punch 16 moves downward to its initial position . the process may be repeated by returning to the step shown in fig2 a . in addition , if the work piece 24 is a helical gear , the process may include rotation of the work piece 24 during ejection and shaping of the inner surface 34 . such processes for rotating helical gears are well known in the art . in this process , the lower core rod portion 38 may have a circular cross section , and the upper core rod portion 36 may have a spline shape for forming splines on the work piece 24 . fig3 a through 3 b illustrate several alternative embodiments of the core rod 22 . in fig3 a , a core rod 122 includes an upper core rod portion 136 and a lower core rod portion 138 , but is created from a single piece of material . in the embodiment of fig1 , the upper core rod portion 36 is one piece and the lower core rod portion 38 is a second , separate piece . the upper core rod portion 136 includes a sizing section 140 and a tapered section 142 . the sizing section 140 , the tapered section 142 , and the lower core rod portion 138 features are formed by machining an original piece of material . in addition , a threaded fastener 32 passes through the core rod 122 and is threadably attached to an internal thread 33 in the support shaft 18 . fig3 b illustrates a core rod 222 that does not require a separate fastener . instead , an upper core rod portion 236 includes an integral threaded section 232 which attaches to an internal thread 235 in a lower core rod portion 238 . the lower core rod portion 238 includes an integral threaded section 237 which attaches to an internal thread 33 in the support shaft 18 . like other embodiments of the invention , the upper core rod section 236 also includes a sizing section 240 and a tapered section 242 . fig3 c illustrates a core rod 322 that also does not require a separate fastener . instead , an upper core rod portion 336 includes an integral threaded section 332 which passes through a lower core rod portion 338 and attaches to an internal thread 33 in the support shaft 18 . again , the upper core rod section 336 also includes a sizing section 340 and a tapered section 342 . the upper core rod portion and the lower core rod portion of any embodiment may be made using well known machining processes , such as turning and milling . the manufacturing process may be modified depending on the type of fastener to be used and the number of pieces of material used to create the core rod . a preferred embodiment of the invention has been described in considerable detail . many modifications and variations to the preferred embodiment described will be apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art . therefore , the invention should not be limited to the embodiment described , but should be defined by the claims that follow .
