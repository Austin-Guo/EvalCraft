a trailer   hitch system comprises a hitch frame adapted to be secured to a vehicle and having a receiver for accommodating a foremost end of a mount unit . the mount unit has a member portion in mating engagement with the receiver of the hitch frame . a connector for connection with a trailer is provided at a rearmost end . the trailer   hitch system also comprises a mechanism actuated to press a portion of the member portion against the receiver for locking the mount unit into the mating engagement with the receiver . a method for locking a mount unit in a receiver of a hitch frame is also provided .
referring to the drawings , and more particularly to fig1 , a trailer   hitch system in accordance with the present disclosure is generally shown at 10 . the trailer   hitch system 10 has a hitch frame 11 , that is shown sectioned at opposed ends . the hitch frame 11 is secured at opposed ends to a frame of a car . for simplicity purposes , the connector ends of the hitch frame 11 are not illustrated , but may be of any configuration as a function of the vehicle to which they are secured . the hitch frame 11 may have any shape so as to be secured to the vehicle . a receiver 12 is transversely positioned with respect to the hitch frame 11 . the receiver 12 accommodates an end of a connector mount . therefore , the receiver 12 is preferably tubular . in fig1 , the receiver 12 is illustrated as being a generally square   section receiver , although other sectional shapes are considered as well . a throughbore is provided in the square   section receiver 12 , and is illustrated as 13 . the throughbore 13 receives a hitch pin 14 so as to lock a connector mount therein . a hook 15 may be provided , for instance to lock a trailer to the trailer   hitch system 10 . a lock ( not shown ) connects into the hook 15 and therefore blocks the hitch pin 14 in the throughbore 13 . referring concurrently to fig1 and 2 , a ball   mount unit 20 is sized so as to be matingly received in the square   section receiver 12 . the ball   mount unit 20 has a member 21 that is complementarily shaped so as to be accommodated in the receiver 12 . a bracket 22 , herein a right   angle bracket , is secured to a rearmost end of the member 21 . the bracket 22 supports a connector , such as hitch ball 23 . other types of connectors may be used as alternatives to the hitch ball 23 with the mount unit 20 . as illustrated in fig2 , the hitch ball 23 is connected to the bracket 22 by a bolt . referring to fig2 , the member 21 is preferably a tube having a pinhole 25 . the pinhole 25 is positioned and sized so as to be aligned with the throughbore 13 when the unit 20 is in the receiver 12 , for the hitch pin 14 to be passed therethrough . a pair of openings 26 are also defined in the member 21 , so as to allow radial movement of abutments with respect to the member 21 , as will be described hereinafter . referring to fig3 , a wedge bar 30 is inserted into the member 21 , and may move axially therein . more specifically , the wedge bar 30 is in threaded relation with an actuator bolt 31 , with the actuator bolt 31 being idled to the bracket 22 . therefore , rotation of the actuator bolt 31 results in the axial movement of the wedge bar 30 in the member 21 . the wedge bar 30 features a pair of wedge surfaces ( i . e ., at least one ), with the wedge surfaces 32 being in a wedged orientation with respect to a longitudinal axis of the wedge bar 30 . other actuation configurations are considered in alternatives to the threading engagement to actuate the translation movement of the wedge bar 30 in the member 21 , such as pistons , levers , two   bar linkages or the like . abutments 33 are in sliding engagement with the wedge surfaces 32 . moreover , the abutments 33 are held captive in the member 21 . therefore , a translation of the wedge bar 30 with respect to the member 21 will cause a radial projection or retraction of the abutments 33 as a result of the sliding engagement of the abutments 33 on the wedge surfaces 32 . referring concurrently to fig4 a and 4b , it is shown that the abutments 33 are in a retracted position . referring to fig5 a and 5b , it is observed that the abutments 33 are in a projecting position . the abutments 33 may have a resilient coating ( e . g . rubber , polymers ), with the resilient coating being of relatively high hardness for the use of the abutments 33 . still referring to fig3 , it is shown that slot 34 has an oblong section . the oblong section is provided so as to allow the translational movement of the wedge bar 30 in the member 21 , despite the pin 14 ( fig1 ) being in the pinhole 25 . now that the various components of the trailer   hitch system 10 have been described , a method for using the trailer   hitch system is set forth . firstly , the ball   mount unit 20 is inserted into the receiver 12 . more specifically , the member 21 is matingly fitted into the square   section receiver 12 . in order to insert the ball   mount unit 20 into the receiver 12 , the abutments 33 must be in the retracted position , as shown in fig4 a and 4b . when the pinhole 25 is aligned with the throughbore 13 , the hitch pin 14 is inserted into the throughbore 13 to lock the ball   mount unit 20 in position in the receiver 12 . when the hitch pin 14 is in the throughbore and pinholes 25 , the abutments 33 are moved to their projecting position ( fig4 a and 4b ). more specifically , a tool such as a wrench or ratchet is used to rotate the actuator bolt 31 in the appropriate direction . this will cause a translation of the wedge bar 30 , and thus the radially outward movement of the abutments 33 to the projecting position . the abutments 33 will press against an inner surface of the receiver 12 , thereby blocking the member 21 to the receiver 12 by friction . the trailer may then be hitched to the hitch ball 23 , although the trailer may also be hitched at any appropriate moment after the member 21 is received in the receiver 12 . in order to remove the ball   mount unit 20 , the actuator bolt 31 is rotated in the opposite direction , so as to cause a radially inward movement of the abutments 33 . the trailer may be unhitched from the ball   mount unit 20 before the removal of the ball   mount unit 20 . in fig7 and 8 , there is illustrated an alternative to the wedge mechanism shown in fig1 to 6 . in fig7 and 8 , nuts 40 are provided on an exterior surface of the receiver 12 . accordingly , bolts 41 are screwed through the nuts 40 and into the receiver 12 , so as to press the member 21 against an inner surface of the receiver 12 . the free ends of the bolts 41 may be provided with a resilient tip , in a fashion similar to that of the resilient coating of the abutments 33 . as a result , the ball   mount unit 20 â€² is locked to the receiver 12 . any similar mechanism may be used as well .
