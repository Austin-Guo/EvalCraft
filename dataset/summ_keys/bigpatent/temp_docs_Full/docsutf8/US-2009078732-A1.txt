this is a device where one component is a member which , without recourse to any tools , can be attached to or removed from a tow   ball that is anchored to or integral with a tow   bar . the member is rigidly located and unable to move in any plane or about any axis when it is engaged with the tow   ball and the remainder of the device . the member has an integral platform that can be used to support and or tow any desired object e . g . bicycles on a rack attached to the platform .
in fig1 the tow   bar 1 has a hole 2 . the part of the tow   bar 1 that joins to the back of the associated vehicle ( not depicted ) is drawn as ragged to distinguish it from the free end which is furthest from the back of the vehicle and has a rounded outline . in the following description the term “ front ” applies to being nearer to the vehicle and the term “ rear ” applies to being further away from the vehicle to which the tow   bar 1 is attached . the tow ball 3 has a seating flange 4 and a stem 5 . the tow   ball 3 is secured with a spring washer 6 and securing   nut 7 that fit the stem 5 after it has passed through the hole 8 in the anchoring   plate 9 and the hole 2 in the tow   bar 1 . the bottom face of the anchoring   plate 9 is flat to engage the flat upper face of the tow   bar 1 . the rear of the anchoring   plate 9 is shaped to lie within the outline of the rear of the tow   bar 1 . the top face of the anchoring   plate 9 is flat . some tow   bars 1 are angled upwards forward of the tow   ball 3 ( refer fig2 ). the dimensions of anchoring   plate 9 are therefore set to ensure that when holes 8 and 2 align the front edge of anchoring   plate 9 does not extend forward of the place , if any , where the tow   bar 1 starts to bend upward . if this requirement is not met the flat anchoring   plate 9 is distorted when the securing   nut 7 is tightened and the flange 4 acts to bend the anchoring   plate 9 into a contour that matches the angled section of the tow   bar 1 . the anchoring   plate 9 has lugs 10 and 11 that extend down and fit snuggly alongside opposite sides of the tow   bar 1 . the lugs 10 and 11 have holes 12 and 13 respectively . the diameter of the hitching   pin 14 is matched to the diameter of the holes 12 and 13 . the lugs 10 and 11 are long enough to ensure that a hitching   pin 14 passing between the holes 12 and 13 will clear the underside of the tow   bar 1 . the shape of the lugs 10 and 11 is such that they do not interfere with a spanner tightening the securing   nut 7 on the stem 5 after it has passed through the hole 8 and the hole 2 . in addition the holes 12 and 13 are positioned in a manner that allows the hitching   pin 14 to pass between them without fouling the securing   nut 7 or the stem 5 . rotation of the anchoring   plate 9 , about the axis of the stem 5 , is limited by the lugs 10 and 11 embracing the sides of the tow   bar 1 . the inability of the anchoring   plate 9 to rotate on the axis of the stem 5 is retained even if the securing   nut 7 is not tight enough to generate sufficient friction between the anchoring   plate 9 and the tow   bar 1 to prevent one turning on the other . the foot   plate 15 has downward extending lugs 16 and 17 that have holes 18 and 19 respectively . the diameter of the holes 18 and 19 are matched to the diameter of the holes 12 and 13 and are positioned so that the hitching   pin 14 can pass through holes 19 , 13 , 12 and 18 when the underside of the foot   plate 15 is uniformly separated from the topside of the anchoring   plate 9 by a distance of 0 . 5 to 1 millimetre . the 0 . 5 to 1 mm tolerance between the foot   plate 15 and the anchoring   plate 9 allows subtle tilting of the foot   plate 15 about the axis of the hitching   pin 14 . the relevance of this tolerance and possible tilting relates to fitting the device to tow   balls 1 which have dimensions which vary slightly from that nominated by the manufacturer . see below for further details . the lugs 16 and 17 fit snuggly alongside the lugs 10 and 11 when the foot   plate 15 is linked to the anchoring   plate 9 by passing the hitching   pin 14 through the aligned holes 19 , 13 , 12 and 18 . the foot   plate 15 has a hole 20 that is centered over the hole 8 in anchoring   plate 9 when the holes 19 , 13 , 12 and 18 are aligned . hole 20 is sufficiently large to ensure that the foot   plate 15 can pass over the tow   ball 3 and the flange 4 . the hole 20 is also large enough to ensure that its edge cannot contact the flange 4 after the hitching   pin 14 has located in the holes 19 , 13 , 12 and 18 . tow   balls generally have dimensions that are specified by a government authority . some governments have safety design rules for tow   balls which mandate that the flange 4 has a larger diameter than the head of the tow   ball 3 . the government mandated dimensions generally have a manufacturing tolerance which is typically about 1 mm . the hole 20 is therefore made large enough to satisfy the size criteria listed in the immediately preceding paragraph , for the largest tow   ball dimension likely to be encountered for the nominated tow   ball size being used . permanently attached to the upper surface of the foot   plate 15 is a tube 21 . the walls of the tube 21 are located outside the perimeter of the hole 20 . in fig1 tube 21 has a square cross   section but a circular or other cross   section is satisfactory provided the walls do not encroach on the hole 20 . the top of the tube 21 has a platform 22 permanently attached to it . the platform 22 thus caps the top of the tube 21 . any desired attachment 26 can be rigidly linked to or articulated with the platform 22 by means that would be obvious to those skilled in the art . tube 21 is set to a length that ensures , that even if the locking   nut 7 is not attached , the tow   ball 3 can only pass up the tube 21 to a point where the stem 5 still protrudes sufficiently through the hole 8 to engage the hole 2 while the foot   plate 15 remains attached to the anchoring   plate 9 by the hitching   pin 14 being located across the holes 19 , 13 , 12 and 18 . after passing through holes 19 , 13 , 12 and 18 the hitching   pin 14 is secured in position with a retaining   pin 23 through a hole 24 in its end . the hitching   pin 14 can have a further suitably located hole 25 that accepts a padlock to deter removal of the hitching   pin 14 and theft of any of the illustrated components of the device . specific hitching   pin locks , which have been described by others , can also be deployed to deter theft . the lugs 10 and 11 on anchoring   plate 9 are made short enough to preclude the stem 5 from disengaging with the hole 2 whenever the hitching   pin 14 is engaged , below the tow   bar 1 , with the holes 19 , 13 , 12 and 18 . this arrangement ensures that it is impossible for the assembled device to separate from the tow   bar 1 even if the securing   nut 7 is absent . this arrangement also means that when the hitching   pin 14 is locked in position it is not possible to steal the device by undoing the securing   nut 7 . the rear of the tube 21 has a threaded hole 27 that accepts a setting   screw 28 that in turn carries a locking   nut 29 . the setting   screw 28 is critical to controlling rotation of the foot   plate 15 about the axis of the hitching   pin 14 . controlling this rotation stabilizes the position of the tube 21 relative to the tow   bar 1 . the setting   screw 28 is also critical to avoiding rattles between the foot   plate 15 and the anchoring   plate 9 and also rattles between the tube 21 and the tow   ball 3 . the integrity of the connection between the anchoring   plate 9 and the foot   plate 15 is assured whenever the hitching   pin 14 is permanently engaged in the holes 19 , 13 , 12 and 18 . the setting   screw 28 is only necessary to avoid undue rotation of the foot   plate 15 around the axis of the hitching   pin 14 . the setting   screw 28 is tightened just up to the point where no rotation of the foot   plate 15 , about the hitching   pin 14 , is possible . over tightening setting   screw 28 results in a constant compression force on the tow   ball 3 and this makes it impractical to readily insert and remove the hitching   pin 14 through the holes 19 , 13 , 12 and 18 . the setting   screw 28 is made only finger tight to eliminate rattles and is then locked in position with the locking   nut 29 . the setting   screw 28 may need readjustment at a later time if significant wear or distortion of the engaged components occurs with prolonged use . the setting   screw 28 does not perform the same function as the “ t ” locks ( parts 17 ) disclosed in new zealand patent number 226926 . those “ t ” locks generate constant compression forces against a tow   ball and thereby friction between the tow   ball and the “ t ” locks as well as friction between the tow   ball and the cylinder supporting the “ t ” locks . the stability of the device disclosed in the current application is not dependent upon friction between the tow   ball 3 and the setting   screw 28 . in addition the properly adjusted setting   screw 28 does not need to be tightened or loosened every time the tube 21 is engaged with or removed from the tow   ball 3 . this is totally different to the mechanism disclosed in new zealand patent number 226926 where the “ t ” locks have to be released and tightened each time that mechanism is attached to or removed from a tow   ball . when the tow   ball 3 has known dimensions , which do not vary between batches , there is no need for a setting screw 28 if the internal dimensions of the tube 21 , at the level of the head of the tow   ball 3 , is matched to the diameter of the equator of the head of the tow   ball 3 referring now to fig2 , this is a side view of the device fitted to a tow   bar 1 that has an angulated segment between the tow   ball 3 and the vehicle ( not illustrated ). the various components are numbered as for fig1 . the part of the tow   ball 3 and the setting   screw 28 that are inside the tube 21 are depicted with broken lines . fig2 clarifies how , with the hitching   pin 14 in place , the device cannot release from the tow   bar 1 , even if the securing   nut 7 is absent . fig2 also demonstrates how the setting   screw 28 can avoid rattles by tilting the tube 21 , about the axis of the hitching   pin 14 , and thereby simultaneously taking up any slack between the rear of the tow   ball 3 and the neighboring face of the inside of the tube 21 as well as between the underside of the foot   plate 15 and the topside of the anchoring   plate 9 . point a indicates the location where the underside of the tilted foot   plate 15 contacts the topside of the anchoring   plate 9 . it should be appreciated that modifications and alterations obvious to those skilled in the art are not to be considered as beyond the scope of the present invention . for example , any alternative means , such as welding , of securely attaching anchoring   plate 9 to the tow   bar 1 may be adapted . alternative means of attaching anchoring   plate 9 to the tow   bar 1 would be essential if the tow   ball 3 was manufactured as an integral part of the tow   bar 1 .
