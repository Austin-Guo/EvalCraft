a device for providing thermal therapy to the perineal and rectal areas of a patient is provided . the device can be used alone or in conjunction with an absorbent pad . the device is particularly useful for alleviating post   partum swelling and pain . different embodiments of the device can be used to provide either hot or cold therapy to a patient .
referring now to fig1 the subject invention is a device 10 for applying thermal therapy to the perineal or rectal area of a patient . the device 10 includes an elongated pack 12 for producing a thermal treatment . in the preferred embodiment , the thermal treatment is produced through a chemical reaction of two chemical compounds which , when mixed , produce either an endothermic or exothermic reaction . in the preferred embodiment , the pack 12 includes an outer shell means 14 for placement against a patient &# 39 ; s perineal or rectal area . the outer shell 14 is formed of a pliant , non   woven , fluid   impervious material . examples of such materials include co   extruded poly back non   wovens , polyester and rayon blends and spun bond . the preferred material is co   extruded poly backed non   woven . it is desirable to use a fluid   impervious material because it allows the maximum amount of thermal therapy to be available to a patient . if the outer shell 14 is a fluid   absorbent material , the fluid absorbed in the material will tend to act as an insulator against the cold or heat therapy and will reduce the effectiveness of the device 10 . it is also desirable to use a pliant material to maximize the comfort of the device 10 , since it is being placed against sensitive tissue . therefore , it is highly desirable for the outer shell 14 not to include rough edges . in the preferred embodiment , the outer shell 14 is formed from a co   extruded sheet of material 16 having a single seal 18 . also , in the preferred embodiment , seal 18 is placed away from the patient &# 39 ; s tissue so that a uniform surface 20 is in contact with the patient . in the preferred embodiment , a sealed inner space 22 is provided within the outer shell 14 . in another embodiment , the sealed inner space 22 is formed from a separate pouch 24 . in yet another embodiment , the outer shell 14 can form a pouch 26 that forms both the outer shell 14 and inner space 22 . in the preferred embodiment , the sealed inner space 22 is formed of a pouch 24 made of a laminated rollstock , polyester / low   density polyethylene ( ldpe ). other materials which may be used to form the pouch 24 include biaxially oriented nylon laminated to linear low density polyethylene ( lldpe ) and straight polyethylene . the inner space 22 includes a first compartment 28 which contains a first chemical 30 . the inner space 22 also includes a second compartment 32 containing a second chemical 34 . a rupturable wall 36 is also provided between the first and second compartments 28 , 32 . when the rupturable wall 36 is ruptured , the first and second chemicals 30 , 34 are allowed to mix to cause either an endothermic or exothermic reaction to occur . when heat therapy is desired , the first chemical 30 may be taken from the group consisting of sodium acetate and sodium thiosulfate , and the second chemical 34 may be taken from the group consisting of borax and aluminum oxide so that when the first and second chemicals 30 , 34 are exposed , an exothermic chain reaction occurs . similarly , when cold therapy is desired , the first chemical 30 may be taken from the group consisting of ammonium nitrate and urea , and the second chemical 34 may be taken from the group consisting of water and additives so that when the first and second chemicals 30 , 34 are mixed , an endothermic reaction occurs . in the preferred embodiment , the elongated pack 12 is generally rectangular and of a length designed to contact at least one of the perineal and rectal areas . in another embodiment , the pack 12 may be long enough to cover both areas . in one embodiment , the first compartment 28 is formed of a rupturable sealed bubble 38 . the bubble 38 is located entirely within the sealed pouch 24 . the second compartment 32 is formed from an area 42 remaining between the sealed bubble 38 and the inner wall 40 of the pouch 24 . accordingly , the bubble 38 contains the first chemical 30 , and area 42 contains the second chemical 34 . for example , bubble 38 may contain water 44 , and area 42 may contain ammonium nitrate 46 . when the bubble 38 is ruptured , the ammonium nitrate 46 and water 44 mix to produce an endothermic reaction , resulting in cooling . as illustrated in fig4 in another embodiment of the invention , the outer shell 14 of the device 10 is formed from first and second sheets of a fluid   impervious material 48 , 50 . the first and second sheets 48 , 50 are sealed to one another around the edges to form a sealed inner space 22 . a third rupturable sheet 52 is located between the first and second sheets 48 , 50 . the third sheet 52 is sealed to at least one of the first and second sheets 48 , 50 around the edges of the third sheet 52 so that a first compartment 28 is formed by an area 54 between the first and third sheets 48 , 52 and a second compartment 32 is formed in the area 56 between the second and third sheets 50 , 52 . another embodiment of the invention is illustrated in fig5 . as can be seen in this figure , the device 10 is formed from two sheets of material . a first sheet 58 is used to form an outer shell 60 . a second sheet of material 62 is a rupturable material . the second sheet 62 is sealed about its edges to the first sheet 58 to form a first compartment 64 . the first sheet 58 is then folded over the second sheet 62 and sealed about its edges to form a second compartment 66 . first and second chemicals 68 , 70 are inserted in the first and second compartments 64 , 66 respectively . in a particularly preferred embodiment illustrated in fig6 the first compartment 72 is formed from a bubble 74 made of laminated film made of polyester / ldpe and is filled with water 76 . the second compartment 78 is formed from a second single sheet 80 of polyester / ldpe . the second sheet 80 is folded to surround and encase the bubble 74 . the second sheet 80 is sealed along its opposite folded edges 82 , 84 to form an envelope type pouch 86 which forms the second compartment 78 . the second compartment 78 is then filled with ammonium nitrate 88 . the remaining edges 90 , 92 between the opposite folded edges 82 , 84 are then sealed to seal the second compartment 78 . in the preferred embodiment , the bubble 74 has a perforated area 94 which weakens the bubble 74 and allows it to rupture prior to any rupturing of the second sheet 80 . thus , when pressure is applied to the device 10 , the perforated area 94 will rupture first to allow the water 76 and ammonium nitrate 88 to mix , thereby producing the desired endothermic reaction . in other similar embodiments , other chemicals may be used as described above to produce an exothermic reaction . in another embodiment of the invention as illustrated in fig7 multiple thermal packs 96 , 98 , 100 are connected to one another and can be detached from one another as desired . in the preferred embodiment , each pack 96 , 98 , 100 is generally rectangular in shape and has opposed first and second narrow ends 102 , 104 . a first end 102 of one pack 96 is attached to a second end 104 of an adjacent pack 98 . in the preferred embodiment , a perforation 106 exists between the first and second ends 102 , 104 to make the packs separable from one another . in yet another embodiment illustrated in fig8 each device 10 may include one or more tabs 108 which can be used to attach the device 10 to a holding mechanism such as a sanitary pad belt or other device ( not illustrated ). another attachment means 110 may be provided . the attachment means 110 may be an adhesive strip 112 or other securing mechanism . finally , in another embodiment of the invention / illustrated in fig9 a reusable pouch 114 containing a gel or other material 116 can be used in conjunction with a single use disposable pouch 118 . the gel 116 may be heated or cooled as desired and then placed inside of the disposable pouch 118 . in this way , the possibility of cross   contamination through multiple uses of the same pouch 114 can be reduced by having a new surface 120 in contact with the patient for each use . while the invention has been described in detail and with reference to specific embodiments thereof , it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention .
