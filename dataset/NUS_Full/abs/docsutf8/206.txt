Use of Contextualized Attention Metadata for Ranking and Recommending Learning Objects
ABSTRACT
The tools used to search and find Learning Objects in different 
systems do not provide a meaningful and scalable way to rank or 
recommend learning material.  This work propose and detail the 
use of  Contextual Attention Metadata, gathered from the 
different tools used in the lifecycle of the Learning Object, to 
create ranking and recommending metrics to improve the user 
experience.  Four types of metrics are detailed:  Link Analysis 
Ranking, Similarity Recommendation, Personalized Ranking and 
Contextual Recommendation. While designed for Learning 
Objects, it is shown that these metrics could also be applied to 
rank and recommend other types of reusable components like 
software libraries.
