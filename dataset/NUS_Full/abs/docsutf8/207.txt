Use of Relative Code Churn Measures to Predict System Defect Density
ABSTRACT
Software  systems  evolve  over  time  due  to  changes  in 
requirements, optimization of code, fixes for security and 
reliability bugs etc. Code churn, which measures the changes 
made to a component over a period of time, quantifies the extent 
of this change.  We present a technique for early prediction of 
system defect density using a set of relative code churn measures 
that relate the amount of churn to other variables such as 
component size and the temporal extent of churn.   
Using statistical regression models, we show that while absolute 
measures of code churn are poor predictors of defect density, our 
set of relative measures of code churn is highly predictive of 
defect density. A case study performed on Windows Server 2003 
indicates the validity of the relative code churn measures as early 
indicators of system defect density. Furthermore, our code churn 
metric suite is able to discriminate between fault and not fault-prone
binaries with an accuracy of 89.0 percent.
